<p class="h2">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Renunciation.</span></p>

<p class="indent">Two men, side by side, were slowly pacing the
deck of the <i>Empress of India</i> on her outward
voyage to Japan. A week had almost passed
since the boat had sailed from Vancouver, and
the extremely bad weather encountered until this
afternoon had prevented all but the most
hardened good sailors from penetrating from
below. Now, however, the wind and sea had
somewhat abated, the first ray of sun had
brought the storm-tossed and sea-sick from their
berths, and the broad decks were soon swarming
with passengers of both sexes, whose faces and
general demeanour expressed entire satisfaction
at their restored liberty.</p>

<p class="indent">Monsieur de Güldenfeldt, the newly-appointed
Swedish Minister to Japan, though an experienced
and enterprising traveller, was watching
this motley crew through his eye-glass with an
amused and somewhat quizzical expression. He
had seen many such scenes, and yet to his observant
mind they were ever new and always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
entertaining. He was at the present moment
occupied in gazing at a French priest, a German
commercial traveller, and a cadaverous-looking
Englishman discussing with varied gesticulations
some point in the political situation, on which
question each appeared as ignorant as he was
positive, and he was vaguely wondering what
means they would ultimately find to unravel the
tangled skein, when he felt his companion, a tall
dark man with a black moustache and a distinguished
nose, grip him by the arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By Jove, de Güldenfeldt!&quot; exclaimed the
latter excitedly, while an unusual air of animation
lit up his somewhat sleepy eyes, &quot;Isn't that
Mrs. Norrywood? That woman about whom
there has been all that fuss, you know. Or am I
dreaming?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Monsieur de Güldenfeldt glanced along the
deck and fixed his eyes on a lady who, all unconscious
of the notice she was attracting, slowly
came towards them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not much doubt on that point, I fancy,&quot; he
replied, as the tall, graceful figure passed near
them. &quot;I've known her for years. As one knows
people about Town, you know. Dined with her,
and that sort of thing. There's no mistaking her.
Sapristi! what a beautiful woman she is! I
wonder if Martinworth is on board: if they are
together, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
Sir Ralph Nicholson pensively stroked his
moustache, but did not reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would give me intense satisfaction to be
acquainted with the rights of that story,&quot; continued
de Güldenfeldt. &quot;It was an uncommonly
mixed up affair. Doubtless, Nicholson, you will
put me down as a fool, but I believe that I am
one of the few people who, after having followed
the evidence from the beginning to the end, still
believe in her and Martinworth's innocence.
Why! you can't look into that woman's eyes,
and not feel convinced that she is all right. I
defy you to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear fellow, it is just because she looks so
uncommonly innocent and pure, and all that sort
of thing, that she's probably as bad as they make
'em,&quot; replied Sir Ralph sententiously. &quot;You are
such a devilishly indulgent fellow, de Güldenfeldt.
All the many years that I have known you, and all
the time you were posted in London, I hardly ever
heard you utter a word against a soul: especially
if the individual discussed happened to be a
woman. Yet heaven knows, in the course of a
long and successful career you must have had
plenty of knowledge of the fair sex and their
peculiar little ways.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Believe me, my dear boy,&quot; replied de
Güldenfeldt somewhat gravely, &quot;women are far
more sinned against than sinning. But it's no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
earthly use arguing with a juvenile cynic, such as
no doubt you consider yourself, on this much disputed
point. At present, you have all the censoriousness
and hard-heartedness of youth on
your side. Only wait ten or fifteen years--till
you are my mature age--and then tell me what
you think about the matter. But,&quot; he added,
&quot;to return to our friend Mrs. Norrywood. You
have no notion what a brute was Norrywood.
It was only after years of neglect and infidelity,
even downright cruelty on his part, that his wife
took up at last with that nice fellow Martinworth.
One only wonders she didn't console
herself ages before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But surely it was <i>she</i> who started the divorce
proceedings?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. You see one day things came to a
climax when she--oh! Well, don't let's go over
the whole sordid history. Suffice it to say, that
no woman with a particle of self-respect could,
knowing what she knew, put up a day longer with
such a blackguard. Then he--Norrywood--you
know, brought the counter charge against her,
poor soul, and Lord Martinworth; and at one
time things were made to look uncommonly
black against them. However, nothing was
proved, for the excellent reason, in my opinion,
that there was absolutely nothing to prove. And
in the end she got her divorce right enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
&quot;Yes, and everyone said she would marry
Martinworth within the year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, the year is almost past. We shall see
whether everyone was right, and whether Martinworth
is on board; and if so, in what capacity.
Here she comes again. I shall stop and speak to
her this time, I think,&quot; and Monsieur de Güldenfeldt,
hat in hand, went towards the lady.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you do, Mrs. Norrywood,&quot; he said;
&quot;how extremely pleasant it is for me to think
that we are fated to be travelling companions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The person addressed stopped a moment in her
walk, raising her clear grey eyes, in which lurked
a look of annoyance and of slight surprise, to
Monsieur de Güldenfeldt's face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think,&quot; she said very slowly but very clearly
and incisively, &quot;you have made a mistake. I am
no long--I am not Mrs. Norrywood. My name
is Nugent,&quot; and with a slight bow she swept past
him.</p>

<p class="indent">With a look of stupefaction on his expressive
face, Monsieur de Güldenfeldt's outstretched
hand fell slowly to his side as he stared after the
retreating form.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned slowly round to Sir Ralph, who had
been watching the whole incident with interest
and considerable amusement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me, Ralph,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;am I dreaming?
Is it not Mrs. Norrywood? Is it her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
double? But what a fool I am,&quot; he added; &quot;of
course there is not a doubt of it. The fact is, my
dear boy, that I--I, Stanislas de Güldenfeldt, have
been deliberately cut by one of the prettiest and
smartest women in Town. A by no means
pleasant experience, I can tell you!&quot; and Monsieur
de Güldenfeldt, with a twinkle in his blue
eyes, gave a little shake to his shoulders that was
distinctly foreign and decidedly expressive.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; smiled Nicholson, &quot;if she had snubbed
a nobody like me, now, there would have been
nothing to be surprised at. Precious glad, though,
I didn't give her the chance,&quot; he added, with a
cheery laugh. &quot;I should never have survived it,
whereas a diplomat like you can of course, get
even with her any day. Forgive my laughing, de
Güldenfeldt, but really it was rather a comic
spectacle for an onlooker, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Laugh away, laugh away, my dear boy. Perhaps,
however, when your hilarity has spent itself,
you will kindly help me to unravel this
mystery. What the dickens does it mean, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! I don't think we need go very far for
an explanation. Probably she is going out to the
Antipodes to try and start afresh. Of course, the
first step towards that operation is to wipe out the
past. So she begins by cutting her old friends,
you see. 'Pon my word, I admire her pluck. But
I shall take warning from your adventure, and before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
making a move shall wait with resignation
until Mrs. Norrywood--I beg her pardon--Mrs.
Nugent, condescends to recognise in me a former
acquaintance. It's a beastly bore being snubbed
by a pretty woman, isn't it old fellow? Come,
don't eat me, but let's go below and see if
Martinworth's name is among the list of passengers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the subject of the above conversation
was standing in her cabin, and with flushed cheeks
and a beating heart was thinking deeply. This
meeting with two members of the set in which
she had originally moved had come upon her as
a most unpleasant shock, a shock for which she
was totally unprepared. Indeed, she had been so
taken by surprise that she had behaved, as she
told herself now, in a most unwarrantably tactless
manner. Both de Güldenfeldt and Nicholson
she had known fairly well in the old days, and in
calmly thinking over the circumstances of the
meeting, it struck her what a false step she had
made in this crude attempt of ignoring persons
whom, indeed, it was impossible to ignore. She
remembered now having read in a paper before
leaving England, that de Güldenfeldt had been
named Swedish Minister to the Court of Japan, in
which case she knew that sooner or later she was
bound to come across him again, and as for
Nicholson, it did not take her long to recall that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
his relations with Lord Martinworth had been in
former years of the most friendly nature.</p>

<p class="indent">The meeting with these two men brought back
vividly to Pearl all the wretchedness of her past
life, and it was only now that she realised to the
full the intense relief and sense of freedom that
filled her soul, as she stepped aboard the Atlantic
Liner at Southampton, and had watched the
coast-line of England fade--as she then had
sincerely hoped--for ever from her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Ralph Nicholson had judged the situation
rightly. Pearl Norrywood, or Nugent, had left
England with the firm intention of forgetting
everything connected with her unhappy past. She
was determined, as far as it was possible, to wipe
out all the despair, the hatred, the humiliation of
the last ten years of her life. But in doing this,
she felt there could be no half measures. That in
company with the misery must also be obliterated
all the joy and happiness she had experienced in
the one love of her existence. She told herself
that with this blotting out of the past, Dick
Martinworth must be sacrificed with the rest.
There was a decision of character, a certain
sternness in her nature which she knew would
help her to carry out that determination, and
from the day that she and Lord Martinworth
left the Divorce Court a suspected, but in spite
of all, an unconvicted couple, Pearl Nugent had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
never again seen the man who for a series of
years had exercised so great an influence over
her life.</p>

<p class="indent">She had been but little past twenty when she
put her future into the charge of a husband
whom three months later she learned to
utterly loathe and fear. From that time, every
day, every hour, was a fiery ordeal from which,
indeed, but few women could have hoped to
escape unscathed. The inevitable arose ere long
in the appearance on the scene of the Honourable
Dick Pelham, as he was in those far-away days.
Mr. Pelham had at once been struck by the refined
beauty and grace of the girl with sad grey eyes.
Then in getting to know her well he learnt to
pity her, a feeling which ultimately culminated
before many months passed into a deep and
passionate love.</p>

<p class="indent">It did not indeed take Pelham long to learn
that he worshipped the very ground on which
Pearl trod, and no great interval passed before
he told her so. The world never knew, never
would know, whether Pearl Norrywood had listened
to these protestations. All that it saw was
that she behaved as if she had done so, for from
the day that Dick Pelham commenced to haunt
her side she became another person. She
developed into an extremely beautiful woman.
The grey eyes lost their sadness, the lovely lips
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
learned to smile, and there was a radiance over
the whole charming face that is only seen around
those who love. The world put down this wonderful
transformation to the presence of Dicky
Pelham, and for once the world was right.</p>

<p class="indent">Society indeed at this period of their existence
was more than indulgent to Pearl and Mr. Pelham.
With the indifference and cynicism which characterises
a certain class, not only did it condone,
but it appeared on the contrary to encourage
Pelham's devotion, to smile with approbation upon
the marked and evident intimacy existing between
this happy and good-looking couple. To invite
one without the other would have indeed shown
a total <i>manque de savoir faire</i>, and the same post
that carried a letter begging Pearl's presence at a
certain entertainment, or a certain house, as a
matter of course conveyed another to Mr. Pelham
containing the same request.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet, if the truth were known, this inseparableness,
this constant daily companionship, was
apt at times to prove to both more of a trial than
a joy, more of a curse than a blessing. On
Pelham's side it was a never-ending, feverish
dream of unsatisfied desire, which Pearl was
eternally resisting, eternally fighting against with
all the weapons of her decidedly religious training,
and a genuine and innate purity of heart.</p>

<p class="indent">And thus matters remained for the next five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
or six years. Dick Pelham succeeded in course
of time to the title, and blossomed into Lord
Martinworth, and his devotion to Pearl instead
of cooling increased in intensity as time went on.
One day, after years of waiting and imploring, he
finally succeeded in persuading Mrs. Norrywood
to take the decisive step of issuing divorce proceedings
against her husband. This had long
been his aim. But not only Pearl's hatred of open
scandal and publicity, but her better judgment
had prevented her hitherto from listening to his
persuasions and from acceding to his unwearying
entreaties. A severe, and what indeed
might have proved a fatal injury from a blow
bestowed in one of his ungovernable rages by
the husband who had tortured her for so
many years, finally however, decided Pearl to
give ear to Martinworth's prayers, and at
length to go to the extremity of sueing for a
divorce.</p>

<p class="indent">She succeeded, after days of suspense, in obtaining
her divorce. But whereas she had entered
the court with the smiles and approbation of the
world, she left it with a ruined reputation, a social
outcast, and with hardly a friend to hold out a
helping hand. The decree <i>nisi</i> had indeed been
dearly bought, and as Pearl drove away from the
Divorce Court she was the first to realise and to
acknowledge to herself that in obtaining her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
freedom she had, from a worldly point of view,
brought about her own doom.</p>

<p class="indent">As the judgment was pronounced, Martinworth
cast her one radiant glance, which expressed as
plainly as words &quot;At last you are mine. At last!
at last! after all these years.&quot; But there was no
answering look of triumph in Pearl's eyes, for at
that moment she felt that never again could she
raise them to the face of man. In after times she
often wondered how she had lived through all those
awful days, how she could have remained silent,
drinking in that terrible evidence which her husband
had raked up from the very gutters. Nevertheless
she survived this truly distressing ordeal,
and with a look of utter scorn on her face sat
patiently listening to servants' lies, and to sordid
details of innocent situations, which under the
clever cross examination were transformed into
all that seemed most guilty and most damaging
to her cause.</p>

<p class="indent">She walked away that day with Martinworth,
and as she passed into her carriage people whispered
together and nudged each other. Nothing
had been proved,--and yet, in the eyes of her
world, she knew that everything had been proved.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, of course, she will marry Martinworth
now,&quot; it said. &quot;He is only too willing to make
the position a regular one. That is why she put
Norrywood into the Divorce Court, though evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
she never dreamt the old fox would succeed
thus thoroughly in turning the tables on
her. She has really been somewhat of a fool for
her pains. Why didn't she let things go on as they
were? Why did she want to put old Norry's back
up? She had just as much liberty before as she
will have now, and if she had left him alone
we should never have heard all these abominable
things about her. Of course, before this scandalous
case it was easy enough to feign ignorance
of all their goings on. Now she has put herself
outside the pale altogether, and in spite of that
ridiculous verdict one really cannot continue the
acquaintance. No doubt, once she is Martinworth's
wife,--though of course she won't go to
Court--their country neighbours will call on her,
and she is just the sort of woman to be adored by
the poor people. Pity we can't see her any more.
Such a sweet woman, you know,&quot; etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl knew her world. She heard words such
as these ringing in her ears, and as on the doorstep
of her house she said good-bye to Lord
Martinworth, she vowed to herself never would
she see him again. She was an innocent woman,
whatever the world might call her. Her first
desire had been to have a certain satisfaction in
disappointing the cynics of their laughter, and
by not marrying the man whose name had so
long been coupled with hers, and whom everyone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
had without doubt expected her to marry, to
prove indisputably her innocence. But that was
only a momentary thought. Worthier reasons
against this union soon took root in her mind.
She loved Martinworth with all her soul. The
knowledge flashed upon her, that only by not
marrying him could she prove her devotion to
the man who would willingly have sacrificed all--his
position in society, his future, his life's
ambitions--by bestowing on her the protection
of his name.</p>

<p class="indent">That night all Pearl Norrywood's possessions
were packed. When her arrangements were completed
she sent away her maid, and set herself to the
task of writing a letter. It took her a long, long
time that letter, and tears were streaming down
her cheeks as she penned these words:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;I am leaving you, my darling; for I can
never be your wife. Dick! you must not
blame me for this, for it is just because of
my great love for you that I can never take
your name. The woman who shares that
name must never have had the vile things
said of her that have been said of me in that
horrible Court, this last week. You, in your
great love and generosity, had but one
thought when my freedom was pronounced--I
read it in your eyes, dear. But all
during those dreadful hours it was gradually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
becoming clear to me, I was slowly
realising, that for your sake alone, I must
never give the world the right of confirming
what the world has said. Had I only
myself to think of I would, as you know,
scorn what people may say, and now that I
am free I would marry you, and at last taste
what true happiness is. But, Dick, you are
a public man. You have a great name and
high position to maintain, and the woman
who bears that name must be above suspicion.
Dick! you are no child. You are
a man of the world and of experience, and
therefore I beg of you to look around among
your acquaintances and friends and to ask
yourself if there is a single one who, in spite
of the verdict to-day, will believe in our
innocence? Such being the case, how can
I ruin your life by marrying you?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I feel no bashfulness in writing this
before you speak to me again, for by
expressing my decision I thus make it
impossible for you ever to speak. Yes,
Dick, I am leaving you for ever--for ever.
Do not attempt to find me. All your
efforts will be fruitless, and oh! indeed,
indeed! this separation will be far better
for us both. Do not become hard against
me, Dick, for you will know--you must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
believe, dearest, that it is only my love
that induces me to leave you. One day you
will marry some pure young girl, and you
will then bless me for trying to rectify the
evil that I have done you, and you will perhaps
forgive me for the years that you have
wasted with me. And yet, if having made
a woman in her darkest hour happy, if
having prevented a heart from becoming
cold and callous and cruel, if having cast
many glorious rays of sunshine around an
existence which, without you, would have
been one dark abyss, if having blessed me
with your beautiful, strong, supporting
love, if, having done and given all this,
you think your years have been wasted, let
me tell you, Dick, they have not--they have
not! And now I bid you farewell. What
it costs me to write that word, I alone can
know. For with it I vanish from your life.
If I were strong I should say 'Forget me,'
but you know me as a poor weak woman,
and knowing me thus you will understand
that I can only say 'Forgive me.'</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Pearl</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">For several months Pearl Nugent lived in an
obscure Welsh village, buried like a hermit.
She was awaiting an answer to a letter she had
written to Japan, and in due course it arrived. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
was a satisfactory letter, welcoming her to the
Land of the Rising Sun. Immediately on obtaining
her divorce she had written to her cousin,
Mrs. Rawlinson, begging her to secure a house
for her either in Yokohama or Tokyo, and to
make other arrangements subject to her approaching
arrival.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Rawlinson, who was some years senior to
the girl she loved as a younger sister, was the
wife of an Englishman engaged by the Japanese
Government. She was a clever and large-minded
woman. Many a time had her kind heart ached
for Pearl, and when the divorce proceedings
commenced she had prayed but for one conclusion.
The complication connected with Lord
Martinworth had certainly proved somewhat of a
shock to her well-ordered mind, but in spite of
the compromising evidence, not for one instant
did she allow herself to believe the worst, and the
personal love and pity she felt for the poor, storm-tossed
girl, coupled with Pearl's frank and affectionate
letter, made her long for the day when she
could fold and comfort her within her motherly
arms.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl had merely stated facts, and had asked for
no advice. She knew her cousin well enough to
be confident that none would be offered unasked.</p>

<p class="indent">There was only one other person to acquaint
with her decision. Mr. Hall was her lawyer and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
trustee, an old and valued friend of her father's.
Many a time when a child had he dandled her on
his knee, and to him Pearl now opened her whole
heart, for certain business formalities had to be
transacted connected with her change of residence
and of name, and with regard to her fortune, which
though not large, would be amply sufficient for
her needs. During all those dreary months Mr.
Hall was the only friend she saw. He ran down
from Town constantly, armed as a rule with
documents to sign, and the appearance of
this bright, cheery little man, with a face like a
russet apple, was Pearl's one pleasure during that
period of grief and solitude.</p>

<p class="indent">One day, when she had been in hiding a considerable
time, he paid her one of his welcome
visits. On this occasion, contrary to his habits,
he appeared grave and preoccupied, and it was
only after a certain time that, with a little preliminary
cough, he seemed to make up his mind
to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">He took Pearl's hand between his own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear,&quot; he said gravely, &quot;I want to ask you
something. May I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Mr. Hall, of course you are privileged to
say anything to me. What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pearl, has it never struck you that Lord
Martinworth would hardly be likely to rest satisfied
with the request contained in your letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
&quot;He has been looking for me?&quot; exclaimed
Pearl, flushing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, he has been moving heaven and earth to
find you. Necessarily, his first step was to come
to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And--you said--what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What could I say, but that I was in your confidence,
and that I declined to betray it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you told him nothing--nothing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, in spite of prayers and threats, I of
course divulged nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Was it a shade of disappointment that for a
moment clouded Pearl's eyes Mr. Hall found
himself wondering? At any rate, there was a
pause before she continued in a low voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were quite--quite right, Mr. Hall. Thank
you. Then you think he has got no trace?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Even with the aid of detectives whom, I
hear, he has since been employing, I don't fancy he
has so far discovered your whereabouts. But--
but----&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But--you think there is danger that he may do
so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should say there was every danger. For
one thing, he could easily have me followed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He hesitated, then continued: &quot;My dear
child, you have honoured me with your entire
confidence in this matter, and you must not think
that I wish to take advantage of this fact if, before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
you finally decide to take this important step, I
beg of you to reconsider. You love this man,
and he loves you. His dearest wish--I know
from his own lips--is to make you his wife. Think
what you are giving up, Pearl, by flinging this all
away, by flying from him. Love, happiness,
honour. You--&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forgive me, my dear old friend,&quot; interrupted
Pearl, &quot;love and happiness I know, but not
honour, no, not honour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She rose from her seat and stood by Mr. Hall's
side. Her eyes were wet with tears. &quot;No,&quot; she
repeated in a low voice, &quot;not honour. I should
never gain honour by marrying Lord Martinworth,
for in marrying him I should despise myself.
Think of the ruin to him! Knowing this--feeling
this all the time, should I not, as the years went
on, learn to hate myself for being the cause of his
sacrifice? And though he is so good, so generous,
I know he would never show me he had repented
of the step, my own intuition would be
sufficient. No words would be necessary to tell
me that I had been the destroyer of his life, the
stumbling block in the realisation of his hopes and
of his ambitions. Oh! Mr. Hall, my only friend,
do not turn against me, do not tempt me. I have
told you this before, many and many a time, and
you listened and understood. Do not, I pray you,
at the last moment, try to convince me that I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
unwise, that I am wrong, when I know--I know I
am doing the only thing that can possibly be
right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She paused, but Mr. Hall did not break the
silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If,&quot; she continued with a deeper note of appeal,
&quot;if there were only myself to consider in this
matter, do you think there could be a moment's
hesitation on my part? Do you think I should
care what my world might say--what it would be
sure to say if I married Lord Martinworth? Not
I! No fear of the opinion of a few people who
once called themselves my friend, would make
me hesitate in realising that happiness for which
I have so long pined, and which at one time I
thought was so nearly mine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But now dear friend,&quot; she laid her hand upon
his arm, &quot;let us, I beg you, dismiss this subject,
dismiss it for ever. You know my feelings on
this matter, and once more I implore you not to
try to persuade me against those feelings. Indeed,&quot;
she continued, smiling through her tears, &quot;it
would be useless, for I received a letter two days
ago from Mrs. Rawlinson, and have consequently
taken my passage by the 'Paris,' sailing in a few
weeks from Southampton for New York. So you
see the die is cast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl Nugent's affairs occupied Mr. Hall's
thoughts considerably as he travelled back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
Town that afternoon. &quot;Hum!&quot; he said to himself,
as he unfolded his newspaper and adjusted
his spectacles to the right angle on his nose.
&quot;She thinks herself sincere, poor child, when she
says it is all for Martinworth's sake she doesn't
marry him, but Pearl Norrywood--or Nugent, as
she insists on calling herself now--hasn't been a
woman of society for ten years for nothing; and
she has more consideration for the opinion of
that world over which she reigned so long than
she has any notion of. She is an innocent
woman, but as proud as Lucifer. I know her,
bless her soul! She'll be hanged if she lets
society have the satisfaction of having the laugh
on its side. Of course, she firmly believes she is
sacrificing herself for Martinworth's sake, but it's
confounded nonsense, all the same. I know my
Pearl. Her beastly pride is at the bottom of everything.
Damn it! Why can't she marry the man
and have done with it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Which soliloquy of the worthy old lawyer's
proves that even our best friends are apt to misjudge
us sometimes.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile we have left Pearl Nugent standing
in her cabin debating with herself what she ought
to do. She stood plunged in thought, realising
more and more into what a false position her impulsiveness
had led her. It went without saying
she had mortally offended Monsieur de Güldenfeldt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
She, who could not afford to make a single
enemy, however humble his position, had doubtless
by this rash action incurred the lasting aversion
of one who by the holding up of his little
finger might do her such irretrievable harm in
this new life upon which she was about to enter.
She saw it all clearly enough now, and poor Pearl
laughed a little hollow laugh of wretchedness as
she began to make the few alterations in her dress
necessary for the shipboard dinner. If she had
been somewhat vainer she would have been consoled
by the remembrance that she belonged to a
world where the fascination and charm and beauty
of woman are still dominant features. But Pearl's
self-esteem of late had suffered too severe a blow
for her to put great store on either her beauty or
her qualities of fascination; though if she had
known not only her own powers, but Monsieur de
Güldenfeldt, somewhat better, she need never have
passed through that disagreeable period of regret
and apprehension.</p>

<p class="indent">At dinner, considerably to her dismay, she
found herself placed between her two quondam
friends. She arrived rather late at table, and with
flushed cheeks and a slight bow to each, sat down.
Her soup went away untouched. Then finally
taking her courage in both hands, she resolutely
turned towards the Swedish Minister.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur de Güldenfeldt,&quot; she said with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
slightly tremulous voice, &quot;I must ask your pardon
for my rude, and what must indeed seem to you,
inexplicable behaviour of this afternoon. Will
you--will you believe that I was labouring under
a misapprehension, and be generous enough to
accept this as my only explanation?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was very simply said, and Monsieur de Güldenfeldt
answered her request as simply. He
looked at the beautiful and perplexed face with a
mixture of admiration and amusement in his
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us forget the past, Mrs.--Mrs.--Nugent,&quot;
he said, &quot;and begin afresh. Shall we?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And from that day commenced a friendship
which was to prove an important factor in Pearl
Nugent's life.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">In Lotus-land</span></p>

<p class="indent">Pearl Nugent had every reason to congratulate
herself on her energy in having renounced her
old life and surroundings, for the three years
passed in Tokyo had proved the happiest, and
certainly the most peaceful, of her hitherto somewhat
stormy existence.</p>

<p class="indent">On her first arrival in Japan she had remained
for some weeks--until she had settled herself in
her own house--with her cousin, Mrs. Rawlinson.
It had been a profitable and happy time for both,
and for Pearl especially the association at this
uncertain period of her life with a woman like
Rosina Rawlinson, was beneficial in every respect.</p>

<p class="indent">Everybody in Tokyo knew, respected, and loved
Rosina, as she was generally called behind her
back. It was Rosina to whom one flew for advice
when placed in a slight difficulty, or for
comfort when overcome by a great trouble. It
was Rosina who would get up in the middle of
the night to nurse a sick child, and it was she
who received the confidences of the various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
young men and women of the community, received
them with bright sympathy, and however
trifling, kept them secretly locked within her own
breast. Again it was to Rosina, or to Rosina's
husband, that everybody of importance seemed
to bring letters of introduction, and many was the
helpless and inexperienced globe-trotter whose
appeal for aid had been listened to by Rosina.
Above all, it was Rosina who gave the jolliest,
cheeriest little Bridge dinners in Tokyo, dinners
where the wine and food were both above reproach,
and where the most amusing people, and
those most congenial to each other, were sure to
be gathered together.</p>

<p class="indent">Those little dinners of Rosina's were alone
enough to make her the most popular person in
Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first fortnight after Pearl's arrival, to
her infinite relief, Mrs. Rawlinson, with her usual
tact, had closed her doors to every one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will soon see enough of the people, my
dear,&quot; she said, &quot;without the necessity of being
bored just at present. You and I have plenty to
talk about, heaven knows! So we'll just sit over
the fire and yarn, as that dear sailor boy of mine
calls it, until we are both hoarse. I sent my niece
Amy away on purpose, for I knew you would
have many things to say to me that it's as well she
should know nothing about, and, as for Tom, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
doesn't count, you know, for he's at his office all
day, and he sleeps all the evening. He is a dear
old thing, but I can't say he's a particularly lively
husband. He says I do the talking for both, but
even in that case one expects more than a grunt
as a reply, and I assure you that is often all he
vouchsafes me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Amy?&quot; asked Pearl, &quot;has she grown up
as pretty as she promised to be? I haven't seen
her for four years now, for you remember I was
abroad all that last year she was at school at
Brighton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am anxious to know what you think of
Amy,&quot; responded Mrs. Rawlinson. &quot;Out here
she is considered a beauty. But of course, coming
straight from Europe as you do, and accustomed
to seeing all the loveliest women in Paris
and in London, you may think nothing of her.
People tell me she is the handsomest girl in
Japan, and certainly I have seen no one with such
glorious eyes or brilliant colouring. But I may be
prejudiced in her favour, and therefore, my dear,
I am quite anxious to have your opinion. One
thing, however, I do know, and that is she is the
most terrible flirt that ever was born. What I
have gone through, my dear Pearl, with that girl
no one knows. She has had heaps of offers--good
ones, you know, from diplomats and people
in excellent positions, but my lady turns up that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
pretty nose of hers at one and all. Pure conceit
I call it, for she knows she is penniless. I always
tell her that under the circumstances she is lucky
to have had an offer at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Pearl, &quot;girls at home are now
beginning to find that offers of marriage are not
to be had by merely looking pretty, or even by
being clever and amusing. The practical, modern
young man generally thinks of his pocket before
all other considerations. Looks and intelligence
are quite in the minority, I assure you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course! But I might just as well speak to
a stone wall as to discuss the advantages of
matrimony with Amy. And then, you know, she
behaves so badly. She never shows the least
repentance when she refuses these men one after
the other. She says she knows none of them will
break their hearts about her, and that she has not
the slightest intention of wasting her sympathy
over people who doubtless one and all will be
consoled in less than three months. Such nonsense,
you know, and so hard-hearted! Yes, certainly
Amy is a strange girl. She is really rather a
trial to me sometimes. Yet, in spite of all her
faults, she is wonderfully lovable. I think you
will discover this fact on your own account.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But three years had passed since this and many
such conversations, and Pearl Nugent one lovely
Spring morning was seated in her garden, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
neighbourhood of some magnificent flowering
cherry trees, idly thinking of what those years had
brought her.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl's was a perfect Japanese garden. It was a
garden of the past, a poem--a creation of an art
whose charm and loveliness only a Japanese can
produce. She was seated on the curved branch
of a very ancient pine. A few feet distant from
her stood a little stone shrine, chipped and blemished,
and covered with thick grown moss, while
on her left were uneven rocks, and quaint-shaped
basins of various forms and designs. Two stone
lanterns, green with age, formed on her right a
sort of entrance to the miniature lake dotted with
tiny islands and surrounded by knolls of bright
green grass, from the smooth surface of which
rose the spreading cherry trees, now in full bloom.
Some of these cherry trees had great gnarled
trunks, and were very ancient. Their fallen petals,
covering the turf, formed a carpet like delicate
pink snow, while above was one glorious burst
of blossom, hiding every branch in its mantle of
perfect form and beauty.</p>

<p class="indent">In and out of the little knolls and hills and
elevations, which were reached by stone steps of
various shapes, were sanded paths which looked
as if they never were meant to be trod upon, and
to prevent such a desecration flat, queer shaped
stepping stones were placed in strange and irregular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
positions. Everything was irregular and
unexpected in this fascinating garden. Flowers
were rare, but fine old trees abounded, and shrubs
and ancient pines,--some allowed to grow at their
own sweet will, others dwarfed in stature, and
trimmed by careful training into fantastic and
uncanny shapes.</p>

<p class="indent">Beyond was a distant view of Fujiyama still
wrapped in its white mantle, though great bare
places streaked the mountain, forming weird
shadows where the snow had already melted.
Pearl felt a certain companionship in this grand
old mountain, solitary like herself. She would sit
for hours watching it in all its different, but ever
lovely aspects, at one time in its snowy covering
almost dazzling the eyes in the brilliant morning
sunshine, and later on at eventide but vaguely
distinct through banks of heavy purple clouds, till
gradually fading from view, Fuji would become
merged into the fading sky, finally disappearing
into the shadows of the darkening night.</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes were dreamily fixed on Fuji now,
standing out white and clear. She was not alone,
for de Güldenfeldt lay stretched on the grass at
her feet. His eyes, however, were employed in
studying and admiring what at that moment he
considered far more beautiful, far more entrancing,
than any mountain in the world--namely, his
companion's face.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
Pearl was looking considerably younger and
handsomer still than when she had left England.
Ease of mind and a quiet life had accomplished
their work, and the sweet placid face
bore no traces of the storms that for a time had
marred its beauty, and somewhat hardened its expression.
Her past life was to her like an unhappy
dream, from which she awoke, to discover
with a feeling of infinite relief that it was indeed
but a dream, a dream that had faded away for ever.
She would find herself in her idle moments, trying
to piece the past together, and failing most
strangely in the attempt. The utterly miserable
life she had spent with her husband, her long
moral struggle with Martinworth, those terrible
scenes in the Divorce Court, all the incidents of
those bitter ten years,--now seemed one and all,
like a vanishing and almost forgotten vision. At
times she would deliberately set herself to the task
of the retrospection of each miserable occurrence,
each wretched episode, for there were
periods when her present happiness had the effect
of almost terrifying her--it seemed so impossible,
so unreal. She would then tell herself that it were
best and wisest that she should attempt to recall
what once had been her life, what once had been
her sorrow and despair.</p>

<p class="indent">Could this happiness, could this peace of mind
really be hers? Would it not fade as a dream
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
even as her past was so quickly vanishing from her
mind? How strange! how very strange! she
often thought, that she should experience this
difficulty in remembering. Even Dick Martinworth
was becoming a faint shadow, whose
features, voice, and manner she often found it
hard to recall. And yet she told herself she loved
him as much as ever. She would place his photograph
before her and try to remember scenes
where they had been together, words that had been
spoken between them, and she would be angry
with herself to find how difficult it was for her to
picture those scenes, to recollect those words. All
seemed so far--so very far away, and somewhat
to her dismay, Pearl was beginning to realise that
she had almost achieved the object in view when
she left England--that of complete obliteration,
entire forgetfulness of the past.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The world forgetting, by the world forgot,&quot;
she quoted half aloud as she rose from her seat
and stretched out her hand to pluck a branch of
the heavily-laden cherry tree. &quot;Such is now my
life, but I do not complain, for it has certainly
many advantages--especially one. No one here
ever seems to care to ask awkward questions, and
if they know my secret they treat me none the
worse for it. <i>Is</i> it known, Monsieur de Güldenfeldt?&quot;
she inquired suddenly of her companion.</p>

<p class="indent">The question came very abruptly, so abruptly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
that the Swedish Minister paused before replying.
This was the first time since their meeting on the
boat three years ago, that Pearl, in spite of her close
friendship with Stanislas de Güldenfeldt, had in
any way referred to her past history. He looked
up quickly, wondering what was working in her
mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you ask me that, my dear lady?&quot; he
eventually inquired, flicking the ash from his
cigarette.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, why do I ask it?&quot; she echoed. &quot;Why
do we ever wish to know anything that may
possibly prove painful to us? Why not rest satisfied
with this happy, dreamy, forgetting life?
Why not, indeed? What a true lotus eater I have
become since I came to live in this poetical,
beautiful Japan. I hardly know myself. My life
glides along, and I take no count of the hours, nor
of the days, and to me it is indeed 'always afternoon.'</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'With half closed eyes ever to seem</span>
<span class="i4">Falling asleep in a half dream.'</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Such, indeed, has been my life since I fled to this
'far-off land.' It is delicious, it is almost perfect.
But it must not continue, for I know it is enervating.
Yes, and what is more, my dear friend,
downright demoralising.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You use strong words, Mrs. Nugent,&quot; replied
de Güldenfeldt, raising himself on his elbow, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
gazing into her flushed face with a look of lurking
amusement. &quot;What has upset you to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I don't know,&quot; replied Pearl impatiently,
&quot;I have been feeling for some time that I ought
not to go on in this aimless, indifferent way. It
is only quite lately that I bothered about anything--what
people might think of me, you know.
But the idea has taken possession of me, and
I cannot get free from it. So I decided that I
would ask you to tell me, for I shall surely get the
truth from you. Do they know?&quot; she repeated,
fixing her clear grey eyes on his face. &quot;Do they
know that I am deceiving them--that I am a
fraud, that my name is not really Nugent? Do
they know that my husband and I are divorced?
Do they know--do they know--about?--Do they
know--everything?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you expect me to answer all these questions?&quot;
said de Güldenfeldt slowly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I do. I expect you to be perfectly
honest and frank with me. It is the least you
can do for me, for you call yourself my friend.
And, indeed,&quot; she added, with her sweet smile,
&quot;ever since the day that I first put my feet on
these shores you have proved yourself my best,
my truest friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, I wonder why it should be the duty of
a so-called friend to be given the disagreeable task
of announcing disagreeable facts,&quot; responded de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
Güldenfeldt pensively. &quot;And indeed, Mrs.
Nugent, what good will it do if I repeat all the
gossip that is bound to go on in a place like this?
You can't stop it, you know, any more than you
can hope to turn the tide.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then they do gossip about me?&quot; continued
Pearl with persistency.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course they do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what do they say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, heavens! give me a woman for tenacity
of purpose!&quot; exclaimed de Güldenfeldt, rising
and stretching his long limbs. &quot;By the by,&quot; he
continued, suddenly changing the subject, &quot;do
you know that Nicholson arrived in Yokohama
yesterday? I thought, in spite of his hasty
departure over eighteen months ago now, the
attractions of Japan would ultimately prove too
strong for him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Amy refused him, you know. But I believe
she really liked him all the time. Are you thinking
of her when you speak of attractions?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should say she is the sole and only one. I
know at the time he was awfully hard hit. It was
our conversation that made me think of him.
Never shall I forget the way he stuck up for you
one evening at the Club, when that little brute
Reichter--who has left, thank God--came out
with some garbled version of your story. <i>Mon
Dieu!</i> didn't Nicholson give it him, just! He is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
such a lazy, <i>nonchalant</i> beggar that one never
expected to see him fly into such a passion. We
all stood aghast, while he lashed the mean little
brute with his sarcastic tongue. Yes! you have
got a loyal, good friend in Nicholson, Mrs.
Nugent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And another in you. Yet you change the
conversation to avoid telling me what I want so
much to know. It is not very kind of you, I
think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I suppose you will get your way in the
end,&quot; de Güldenfeldt replied, with a smile, &quot;so I
may as well surrender without further hesitation.
Yes, people know your story, Mrs. Nugent.
However strictly your cousin Mrs. Rawlinson,
Nicholson and I have kept the secret, it has somehow
oozed out. I firmly believe that it was those
globe-trotters--the Clive-Carnishers, who, recognising
you at the last Chrysanthemum Party, set
it about. At any rate, it is known at the English
Legation who you really are, for Thomson spoke
to me about it one day. You see,&quot; he added
deprecatingly, &quot;if you had never entertained, if
you had been ugly and stupid and uninteresting,
people certainly would not have troubled their
heads about you, nor have gone to the bother of
raking up old stories. But being what you are,
charming and beautiful, no matter if you hide
yourself in the moon, no matter if you change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
your name a dozen times, no matter if you live
the life of a hermit--your story, dear lady, will
follow you to the end of your existence. There!
Now I have given in and told you the truth,
and what good will it do you, I should like to
know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has already eased my mind considerably,
only that,&quot; replied Pearl, &quot;I don't know what
has possessed me of late, but I have felt as if I were
a cheat--a fraud. You see, I have grown fond of
the people here, both Japanese and Europeans,
and I have begun to recognise that I was rewarding
their kindness but indifferently. Because I
was Rosina's cousin, everyone, when I first came,
received me with open arms. Then I think they
got to like me a little for my own sake. Now
you tell me they know my story. Well, this
shows, at any rate, that I was right in leaving
England, and choosing instead this dear Japan
as my home. It is only in a place like this that
one would find so much kindness, so much indulgence.
The foreign community is so small, so
very restricted you see, that I suppose people can't
afford to be too exclusive, too particular,&quot; she
added, rather bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">De Güldenfeldt did not reply. He knew
there was considerable truth in Pearl's remarks.
If Mrs. Nugent had remained in England she
would henceforth, necessarily, have only been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
received on sufferance. She would by degrees
have sunk into the ranks of <i>les déclassées</i>,
with no fixed abode, reduced to wandering
from second-rate watering-places to out-of-the-way
continental towns, seeking rest and finding
none. Thus her youth, embittered and disappointed,
would finally have passed, and she who
formerly had ever been welcome within the
portals of good society, would have found herself
crawling on her knees, discrowned, outside those
closed gates. Here, on the contrary, in the
limited European society of the facile East, in
spite of varied and garbled versions of her
story being known, not only did she receive
and was received, but she was considered an
acquisition, indeed, much sought after for her
beauty and sweetness, her charm and many
social talents.</p>

<p class="indent">As de Güldenfeldt walked away from Pearl's
house that day he was very pensive. The
knowledge that he loved Pearl Nugent came as
nothing fresh to his mind. He had been fully
aware of this fact since their encounter long ago
on board the Canadian Pacific liner. At that
time however, if anyone had ventured to tell him
he would have ever contemplated marrying a
woman who had gone through Pearl's unfortunate
experiences, a woman who had been tarred by the
dirty brush of the Divorce Court, he would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
been the first to have scouted the idea as utterly
impossible and absurd.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas de Güldenfeldt was extremely ambitious.
His profession was his god, and ever since
the day he had entered on his career all his natural
tastes and longings, all his passions and desires,
had been subservient to this love of his profession
and to the determination to excel. He was
possessed of many talents and a considerable
amount of good looks, which gifts, combined
with great charm of manner and the attractions
of his position, all helped to made him a favourite
with men and women alike. But a natural cautiousness
of disposition, together with this ruling
love of his profession, caused him to feel general
indifference as far as women were concerned, and
though he certainly affected their society, and was
never otherwise than courteous and charming
towards them, he had, with but one or two exceptions
been but little influenced by the feminine
sex throughout his life. These exceptions had on
each occasion proved themselves episodes rather
of a pleasant than of a painful nature. He had
experienced nevertheless, a certain relief when in
the natural course of events these chapters of his
life were closed, and with a mind free from all
outward influences, once more he could devote
his time and his thoughts entirely to his work.
He would tell himself that in the abstract he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
admired women, that on the whole he thought
them superior to his own sex. Then he would
find himself wondering how it was that in spite of
this undoubted admiration, and what indeed
might almost be called veneration, he had really
loved them so seldom, why the real depths
of his nature had been so little stirred, so little
troubled by their presence. He knew the answer
to that question well enough, but he would seldom
give it even to himself, for he frequently felt irritated
with himself at this entire absorption in his
work, and above all for what he was wont at times
to fancy was an absolute want of sentiment in
his nature.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet as he emerged from Pearl Nugent's
garden that spring morning, Monsieur de Güldenfeldt
realised to the full what he had more or less
known for three years past--that he was even as
others were, and that he could love, love with the
full power of his long pent-up feelings, and
learning this fact, instead of blessing he lamented
his fate. He thought of Pearl with her distinguished
yet perfectly simple air. He thought of
the straight, clear-cut profile, and the firm, rather
square little chin, of those pure and clear grey
eyes, and the habit she had of doubling her
fingers tightly into the palms of her hands. He
thought of those many outward examples of her
firm and reliant character--and his heart sank.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
He felt he desired her above everything in the
wide world, and he knew as surely as he knew he
was himself that if he wished to gratify that
desire he must marry her. Stanislas de Güldenfeldt
had not studied Pearl's character for three
years for nothing. He was confident in his own
mind that she had never listened to Martinworth's
entreaties, and he knew that in spite of the irregularity
of her present position--perhaps for that
very reason--there was a pride, a certain hardness
in her nature, that would debar him from venturing
to propose any union but one which, in the
eyes of the world, was strictly conventional and
correct.</p>

<p class="indent">That day de Güldenfeldt, whistling for his dogs,
started on a solitary walk of some miles, far away
from the stir and haste of the city. It was a perfect
spring day, with a soft breeze blowing, and a
hot sun overhead. Stanislas skirted the fields,
already bright with the young corn, his eyes lingering
on the beauty of the rich and varied
foliage, and on the little knolls of many a secluded
and shaded grove fringed with clumps of feathery
bamboos and an occasional palm waving aloft in
the balmy air. Contrasting with the vivid and
many shaded greens, and always on the loftiest
hill, half hidden in the shadiest spot of the neighbourhood,
would be visible the red portal or <i>torii</i>
of some little shrine raised to <i>Inari Sama</i>--the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
god of farming--or perhaps to some other deity
of the province, while away in the distance rose
a range of purple mountains, and on the east a
streak of sea gleamed like silver in the bright afternoon
sun. He crossed more than one stream of
water, in the cool depths of which groups of stark
naked urchins were frisking in the wild abandoned
gambols of happy childhood. Peasant women of all
ages, wrapped in their scanty upper garments and
blue cotton trousers, far more resembling men
than members of the gentler sex, would pass along
the road, bent and almost hidden beneath overwhelming
burdens of huge bundles of faggots, yet
ever ready with a cheerful greeting as they toiled
on towards the thatched farm houses nestling in
the hamlets and villages beyond. Stanislas longed
to be an artist to depict on paper these simple
scenes of Japanese country life, to be capable of
immortalising this lovely peaceful nature, chief
of which in his eyes were for the present
the snowy blooms of the cherry tree, contrasting
with the sombre cryptomeria pines, and
the brilliant green and red of the giant wild
camellia.</p>

<p class="indent">But Stanislas, equally ignorant of the kodak as
of the paint brush, with a faint sigh of regret
continued his tramp alongside the little square
fields of the fresh young corn, emerald-green in
colour, traversing in his walk many an enchanting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
silent grove, till at length he reached the goal
of his pilgrimage.</p>

<p class="indent">Hidden away in the little village of Meguro,
and overgrown by vegetation, is a miniature and
ancient graveyard. Two grey and battered stones,
half fallen on the ground, and half hidden in the
long rank grass, is all that is left in this old, old
burying ground to mark the last resting place of
the dead. Stanislas knew well the pathetic love
tale connected with these gravestones, placed there
over three hundred years ago, and he paused to
examine once again the faint inscription borne by
one of them. &quot;The tomb of the Shiyoku,&quot; he
read, the Shiyoku being, he knew, fabulous
birds, emblems of love and fidelity. This moss-grown
stone, lying battered and broken before
him, told of a love-tale romantic in many of its
details, and tragic in its ending. There it had
stood for generations, the sole memorial of the
burial place of the robber Gompachi, remarkable
for his valour and great personal beauty, and of
his companion in death, the lovely and loving
courtesan, Komurasaki.</p>

<p class="indent">The story relates how Gompachi after many
murders, was at length caught red-handed and
promptly executed, his body being rescued and
buried by devoted friends in the grounds of the
Temple of Meguro. Komurasaki, getting news of
her lover's death, hied to the spot, wept and prayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
long over the tomb, then drawing the dagger--a
weapon which in those days every woman wore
on her person--from the folds of her &quot;obi,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
 she
plunged it into her heart, and, sinking on the
ground, sighed her last breath over the grave of
her beloved.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<a href="#FNanchor_1_1">
<span class="label">[1]</span></a>
A sash worn over the dress.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The legend continues how the priests, touched
and greatly struck at the devotion of this beautiful
maiden, laid her by the side of her lover, burying
them in one grave. There they placed to their
memory the stone which remains to this day, and
before which incense is burnt, and flowers and
offerings are laid, by all true and devoted lovers.</p>

<p class="indent">Hard by the gravestone under which so long
have mouldered the remains of Gompachi and
Komurasaki, is another memorial which appears
almost as ancient, on which is engraved the following
words which many a time had been read and
translated to Stanislas:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the old days of Genroku, she pined for the
beauty of her lover, who was as fair to look upon
as the flowers, and now, beneath the moss of this
old tombstone, all has perished of her love but her
name. Amid the changes of a fitful world, this
tomb is decaying under the dew and the rain,
gradually crumbling beneath its own dust, its outline
alone remaining. Stranger, bestow an alms to
preserve this stone, and we, sparing neither pain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
nor labour, will second you with all our hearts.
Greeting it again, let us preserve it from decay for
future generations, and let us write the following
verse upon it:--'These two birds, beautiful as the
cherry blossom, perished before their time, like
flowers broken down by the wind before they have
borne seed.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For some time de Güldenfeldt hovered round
this romantic spot, musing long on this old-world
tale of a love, faithful and lasting even in death.
But the time wore on, the shadows lengthened, and
half-regretfully he rose, wending his way to the
Buddhist Temple of Fudo Sama, a spot that he
knew well, buried within a grove of ancient maple
trees.</p>

<p class="indent">This was a very favourite resort of his. He
passed through the <i>torii</i> or stone gateway, bounding
up the many steps that led to the Shrine, and
before which was placed the deep stone-lined basin
of water, kept replenished by the ancient bronze
fountain carved in the form of a dragon, spouting
out from the rock behind.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas sat himself down by the basin, and
lighting a cigarette ruminated on the strange superstition
that to this day induces many a weary and
penitent pilgrim, winter and summer alike, to
stand often for hours at a time under the rushing
waterfall. There they would patiently stand,
praying fervently that the icy water, in cleansing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
and purifying the body would by the intercession
of the merciful and all powerful Buddha, thus
cleanse and purify the soul within.</p>

<p class="indent">De Güldenfeldt lingered for a time beneath the
maple and cherry trees, while bright-faced, bright-clothed
<i>nesan</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
 from the picturesque tea-house
hard by, brought him tiny cups of Japanese tea,
chattering in their happy childish way, with
laughter, smiles and bows. He sat there for over
an hour thinking deeply, and when at length the
sun, sinking behind the hill, warned him that it
was time to go, his resolution was formed.</p>

Waiting maids.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">He would ask Pearl Nugent to be his wife.
After all, what was his profession to him compared
with his great absorbing love? It was true
that hitherto all had been sacrificed to his career,
but that was before he had met Pearl, before the
love that now filled his heart had taught him what
it really was to live and to enjoy. A marriage
such as he contemplated would he knew well, be
a hindrance to his profession, and, consequently, a
severe blow to his ambitions, but for the time
being he banished all thought of personal aggrandisement
from his mind, and as he rose and once
more tramped across the fields, in Stanislas de
Güldenfeldt's blue eyes there was a light, and
round his firm lips a smile, that had been strangers
there for many a long day.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
That same day Mrs. Nugent ordered her carriage
and drove round to her cousin's house. She
made a point of going to see Mrs. Rawlinson
whenever she felt restless or discontented, for
Rosina acted on her nerves like a stimulant. To-day
when she got there Rosina was not at home,
but she found her pretty young cousin Amy Mendovy
seated by the open window, sketching Fujiyama
with the evening glow upon it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forgive my not getting up, Pearl,&quot; the girl
said, &quot;but I must finish this before the sun sinks.
Have you ever seen Fuji looking more divine?
No wonder the Japanese worship the mountain.
Just look at it with that hazy, purple light upon it.
I have been breaking it gently to Aunt Rosy that
I am going to become a Shintoist or a Buddhist,
or something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, indeed. May I inquire why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So that I may worship Fuji, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't see the connection.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, don't you? Then you are very dense,
my dear. Aren't the Japanese Shintoists or Buddhists?
And don't they worship Fuji? Or, if they
don't they hold it sacred, which is very much the
same thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't talk nonsense, Amy. What is the
matter with you to-day? You seem so nervous
and excited. Why! I declare you have been
crying.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
No answer, only energetic daubs of green and
yellow and carmine, all mixed together on the
paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Amy, dear, why have you been crying?&quot;
asked Pearl in her soft voice, laying her hand on
her cousin's arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now my dear Pearl, don't be silly; have you
ever seen me cry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, often. Tears are as near your eyes as
smiles are to your lips, you April day. But tell
me, what is wrong?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here, Pearl,&quot; answered Amy, raising her
sleek head while her eyes flashed, &quot;I won't be
bothered. And if I choose to cry I shall cry, so
there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly, my dear, and as I came to see
Rosina and not you, I have no wish to disturb
you in such a profitable occupation. So I'll take
my departure. <i>Addio</i>,&quot; and Pearl turned towards
the door.</p>

<p class="indent">She hadn't got far, however, before she felt two
strong arms round her waist and various energetic
kisses upon the back of her neck.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come back, Pearl darling. Have some tea
and don't be crusty. Why, I have just been longing
for you. Aunt Rosy is no good, she doesn't
understand me, and never will understand me;
so it's no use trying to make her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to know who does,&quot; said Pearl.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
&quot;Well, you do. So I am just going to tell you
all about it. Come here and sit on the windowsill.
Give me your hand, and let us look at Fuji
till the light dies away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And during a quarter of an hour's silence they
watched Fujiyama that rose up dim and indistinct
against the setting sun. There it stood in all
its solemn majesty, solitary in all its grand repose,
superb in all its noble isolation. The dark lights
grew fainter and more indistinct, the brilliant
blood-red sky with its shifting gleams took paler
shades, till little by little it seemed to mingle with
the misty colouring of the lonely peak, and
behold, even as they watched, night fell, enshrouding
all in its vast impenetrable mantle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, dear,&quot; said Pearl, &quot;it's dark, I can
hardly see your face, so tell me what is the
matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Amy rose abruptly and switched on the electric
light.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As to that,&quot; she said with a nervous laugh,
&quot;pray don't think I am ashamed of being seen.
I've done nothing wrong, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, at any rate there's a certain comfort in
that affirmation,&quot; replied Pearl drily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, now you are laughing at me. Never
mind, I am accustomed to it.&quot; Then, after a
pause, &quot;Pearl, he's come back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who's come back?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
&quot;Don't tease. You know whom I mean--Sir
Ralph Nicholson, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, then it was a matter of course that he
should come back? Well, continue your confession.
He has been here, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. He told me he returned on purpose to
see me, you know. Pearl, he asked me again to
be his wife! He was so kind and nice, but he
seemed to be so awfully sure that I was going to
accept him that I really couldn't help it, but--but--I
believe he thinks that I refused him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now you are sorry, I suppose, and have
been crying about it. Oh! Amy, Amy! You
foolish, foolish girl! Why, you love that man
with all your heart. You have never ceased to
think of him since he left. And now, when just
like in a novel, he turns up again and gives you
another chance, you go and throw it away like
this. I have no patience with you, Amy, and I
don't pity you a bit. You surely ought to understand
that Ralph Nicholson is a man in a thousand.
A delightful man, a clever man, and, from a
worldly point of view, an excellent match. And
pray, who are you, Miss, that you should treat
him like this? If you didn't care for him it
would be another question, but you told me yourself
you have never been happy since you said
'no' before. And now--oh! really, I can't tell
you what I think, I am so annoyed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
Amy's bright colouring paled while Pearl was
speaking. She rose from her seat, and stood with
clasped hand and bent head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pearl,&quot; she replied, with a break in her voice,
&quot;go on--go on scolding me. I feel I deserve
every word you say, and you cannot blame me
more than I blame myself. I can't think what
induced me to behave as I did. But you alone
know how sometimes a spirit of contradiction
takes possession of me, and when he said, 'I have
come back all these thousands of miles to ask you
again to be my wife. You will have me this time,
won't you, Amy?' I just answered--'And pray,
Sir Ralph, why should I answer yes now more
than eighteen months ago? The circumstances, I
imagine, are just the same as far as I am concerned.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You said that? Good heavens! what cruel
creatures women are!&quot; exclaimed Pearl. &quot;And
what was his answer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think he turned very white, and he said--'This,
then, is your only answer after--after all
this time?'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what did you reply?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did I reply? Oh, nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing? Oh, Amy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn't, Pearl. But I did the next best
thing. I went to the piano and played some bars
of a waltz, that waltz of Strauss' to which he and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
I have danced so much in the old days. Of course,
I thought that he would understand by that--that--well--that
I didn't mean 'no' exactly. A
woman would have understood the <i>nuance</i> in a
second, but men are so dense. I put plenty of
expression into my playing, too. But when I
looked up he was gone!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl couldn't help laughing at this very
original form of replying to an offer of marriage.
She took the girl in her arms and kissed her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really, Amy, you are a most extraordinary
girl. What other person would think of doing
such a thing? You really deserve that he should
never come back again. A serious man like Sir
Ralph is not to be coquetted with like a boy. He
put you a question, a question on which depends the
happiness of his life, and all you seem capable of
doing is to reply in this flippant manner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you think I see all that clearly enough
now?&quot; replied Amy mournfully, &quot;and what is
worse, there is a mail going out to-morrow--the
'China,' and I'm convinced he'll sail by it. Oh,
Pearl! do help me. What am I to do? I can't
let him go away again. I really can't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now look here, Amy, if I come to the rescue
in this matter--which is far more than you
deserve, Miss--will you promise to be guided
by me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you know, Pearl,&quot; replied Amy, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
mischievous light in her eyes, &quot;I hate making
promises, for I no sooner make one than I find
<i>c'est plus fort que moi</i>, and lo! it is broken. But
in this case my own interests are so much at stake
that perhaps--perhaps--&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl rose from her seat and began putting on
her cloak.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Amy, Amy! why will you not be more
like other people? You give most people, dear,
such an entirely false impression of your real
nature. But never mind, I am not going to
preach any more to-day. Good-bye! and if Sir
Ralph ever has the temerity to ask you again, try
and behave for once in your life like a rational
being.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl's thoughts were much occupied with Miss
Mendovy as she drove home that afternoon.
She was extremely attached to her young cousin,
and perhaps she sympathised better than most
people with the contradictions of that girlish
nature.</p>

<p class="indent">Amy Mendovy, the only child of a sister of
Mrs. Rawlinson's, was left an orphan while still
an infant. Rosina adopted her, in every way fulfilling
the mother's part. She loved the girl with
all her heart. But in spite of her great affection
and indeed, genuine admiration, she did not
profess in the smallest degree to understand her.
Consequently their ideas, habits, and ways of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
looking at things generally, were hardly what
could be called congenial or sympathetic.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Rawlinson was a simple-minded creature,
and deluded herself with the belief that she was
now extremely modern and up-to-date. If the
truth were known, she had never entirely
recovered from the narrow, Calvinistic training of
her youth, a proof of which was particularly
shown in the prim, little manner she affected
when she thought it necessary to correct her
niece. Amy delighted in rousing that manner,
indeed, at times her chief joy in life appeared to
be that of teasing her aunt. It was only when
she had succeeded in finally driving the poor soul
to the verge of desperation that she would throw
her arms around her neck, coax her, blame herself,
ask pardon--in fact, behave generally in such
a bewitching <i>caline</i> way, that it would indeed be a
stony heart that could resist her, and certainly not
the soft organ that Rosina Rawlinson was generally
credited with possessing.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl as she drove home, was thinking of this
strain of perversity in her cousin's disposition.
She confessed to herself that it added greatly to her
charm, but nevertheless she deeply regretted this
peculiarity, preferring to dwell on those deeper
traits in the girl's character which to others
were so seldom visible. Under the apparently
frivolous, somewhat futile manner, there was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
strength, almost a grandeur of soul, the glimpses
of which more than once had literally taken away
Pearl's breath, so totally had she been unprepared
for such an exhibition. It was strange to hear
some deep thought expressed by those lips, that
seemed formed only for mockery and laughter, and
still stranger to see the flash of cold disdain, of
righteous scorn, that would fill the dark eyes at
the sight of some mean or unworthy action, or at
the sound of some paltry, petty speech.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was only to very few that the beautiful
Miss Mendovy ever showed this finer side of her
nature, and to the world at large she was looked
upon as a girl of moods--original and impetuous--lovely
as a dream, and as heartless as a stone.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER III.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Pains and Penalties.</span></p>

<p class="indent">Sir Ralph Nicholson appeared the next day at
Pearl's house in answer to a note he had found
awaiting him on his return from dining at the
Swedish Legation the evening before. Stanislas
de Güldenfeldt and he were old and intimate
friends, yet in spite of the fact that he was feeling
bitterly mortified at Miss Mendovy's cool reception,
not once did Amy's name cross his lips in
the conversation kept up between the two men
until the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p class="indent">De Güldenfeldt, on the contrary, spoke incessantly
of Pearl, and Ralph wondered if his friend
had the vaguest idea how much he betrayed himself
in every word he let fall. He gazed at him with
amazement. Here was a man who had been
known throughout his career as the most cautious,
the most guarded, and the most reticent of diplomatists,
proving by every remark that passed
his lips, in the very expression of his flushed and
handsome face, the thoughts that were evidently
entirely monopolising his mind. For the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
being the two men seemed to have changed personalities,
and the more de Güldenfeldt spoke of
Pearl, the more silent and reserved did Nicholson
become. He watched him with half-closed eyes
through his cigar smoke, and with a cynicism he
had somewhat adopted of late, found himself pitying
what he chose to designate as his friend's
&quot;state of demoralisation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor old fellow,&quot; he thought, &quot;Japan is spoiling
him. Three years ago one would never have
heard him maudling about a woman in this ridiculous
way. Good Heavens! what confounded
fools these women make of us!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To Mrs. Nugent the following day he gave expression
to almost the same sentiment, though on
that occasion it was entirely in reference to himself.
To her he was as frank and open as he
had been reticent to de Güldenfeldt. Little
by little the whole story came out. How it was
not the charm of the scenery of Japan, not its
people so clever, brave and fascinating, not its
engrossing art, much as he appreciated beautiful
things, in fact none of these attractions that had
recalled him to the country after a few months
absence, but simply the recollection of one little
rebellious curl on Amy Mendovy's white forehead,
the distinct and haunting impression of a seductively
mocking expression in the bright eyes that
had induced him to cast all home duties and pleasures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
to the winds, and had once more dragged
him back to her side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you see, Mrs. Nugent, how I have been
rewarded for my constancy. But then men are
such confounded fools! She refused me eighteen
months ago, you know. Nevertheless I always had
a faint hope that <i>au fond</i> she was not so entirely
indifferent to me, which proves what a conceited,
fatuous ass I am. Perhaps it is only fair that I
should be punished for my folly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And are you so very positive that she does not
care for you?&quot; asked Pearl, looking up into his
face with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Judge for yourself. If a girl cared two straws
for a man, would she in response to an offer of
marriage, after a journey of eleven thousand miles
taken by that unfortunate fellow for her sake, sit
down and begin to strum on the piano? I ask
you, would any girl with a scrap of feeling or of
heart do such an outrageous thing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did she play?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How am I to know? And I'm sure I don't
care. I have no ear for music. Something very
noisy and jingly, that's all I heard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn't recognise the waltz you used to
dance together, then?&quot; and Pearl, without looking
at him, began putting straight the little ivory
<i>netsuke</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
 on her mantelpiece.</p>

Carved objects that attach the tobacco pouch.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
"By Jove!&quot; exclaimed Ralph, jumping from
his seat, &quot;you don't mean to tell me she was playing
<i>that</i>! Now you mention it, the tune did seem
familiar to me. You mean, then, that--Good
Heavens! I see it all now. Mrs. Nugent, what an
infernal idiot I have been!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Pearl quietly, &quot;perhaps you have
been rather a goose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how the dickens was I to know? Who
would ever have imagined she would act in such
an extraordinary way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In all your dealings with that young woman
you must bear in mind that she never does things
quite like other people,&quot; replied Pearl. &quot;That
must always be taken into consideration, and your
own conduct consequently must be dependent
on this knowledge. So, instead of rushing off to
her instantly again, as I see you are dying to do, I
should refrain if I were you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what am I to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should simply for a time take absolutely no
notice of her, and what would be better still, and
would certainly lead to most excellent results, get
up a mild flirtation with someone else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Ralph looked serious. &quot;Mrs. Nugent,&quot; he
said, &quot;I am not a bit that sort of fellow, you
know. I'm really an awful duffer at saying pretty
things to a woman, especially when I don't mean
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
&quot;Never mind, try your best for once in a way.
For take my word for it, if you want Amy as a
wife, you must first rouse her <i>pique</i>, her jealousy.
She feels far too sure of you now, and she will be
surer still if she finds you have no intention of
going off again--as she now half fears you may do.
If I were you, and if really you care to be guided
by me, I should advise you to choose a married
woman for your flirtation, a woman who would
be sensible enough not to take too much <i>au grand
serieux</i> any nonsense you may talk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Ralph Nicholson thrust his hands down into
his pockets and walked to the window. He stood
gazing for some moments out on to the cherry
trees shining like pale pink snow in the brilliant
sunshine. Then he turned suddenly round and
faced Pearl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Nugent,&quot; he said, &quot;I have something on
my mind which I must tell you. May I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied Pearl quietly, &quot;I am accustomed
to receiving confidences. What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it is not a confidence. It is something
about--about you--this time. At least I mean not
about you, but about--Martinworth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl rose from her seat, and going up to Ralph
clutched nervously at his sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked breathlessly, while she
turned very pale. &quot;Is--is he dead?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dead! Good Heavens! No. He was in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
most flourishing state of health when I saw him
last in Paris, but he has nevertheless dished himself
pretty considerably. He is--he is--you must
know sooner or later--he is--married, and--and--what's
more, he is coming out here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is married and he is coming out here!&quot;
Pearl echoed the words in a dull voice as she
stared into Sir Ralph's sympathetic face. &quot;Dick
married and coming out here with his wife! Good
God! what shall I do?&quot; and she remained
motionless with her distressed eyes fixed on
Nicholson.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Mrs. Nugent--my dear lady,&quot; blundered
Ralph, &quot;please don't look like that. For
God's sake, I implore you to sit down! Say--do--something.
I wish I hadn't told you. But I
thought it best, for of course, you are bound to
meet them if they come here. So I thought--I
thought you had better be prepared. But confound
it all! I would have risked anything
rather than that you should have taken it so
badly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This last phrase roused Pearl from the dismay
and stupefaction experienced on first hearing
Nicholson's unexpected news. She managed to
smile while she nervously put her hand to her
forehead and pushed back the curls of her hair.
After all, who was Sir Ralph that she should
betray herself like this? A friend, it is true; a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
valued friend who knew her history; but that
was no reason why he should also become
acquainted with her heart. With an effort that
cost her much she was successful in recovering
a certain amount of control over her features.
She sat down with her back to the light, and,
taking a book from a table, began turning over
the leaves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your news naturally interests me much,&quot; she
said in a voice that she succeeded in rendering
almost indifferent. &quot;Of course, at first it took
me by surprise. I--I'm sure I don't know why--but
I--I--never thought Lord Martinworth
would marry. Whom--whom has he? Sir
Ralph, would you mind telling me if his wife is
anyone I know? Whom has he married?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alas! for Pearl's reputation for imperturbability,
these last questions were asked in a very low, a
very unsteady voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh yes, you know her. You must have seen
her knocking about Town for a dozen seasons at
least. He has married that extraordinary type: his
cousin, Lady Harriet Joyce; the large, fair one,
who generally goes by the name of 'Harry'&quot;----</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Harry Joyce! Oh yes, I remember her,&quot; said
Pearl quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has run him down at last. She and her
people have been trying it on for years, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
Pearl did not reply. When she next spoke
it was excessively calmly, on a totally different
subject.</p>

<p class="indent">But oh, the bitterness of it all! She sat and
thought it all over when Sir Ralph had left her.
So Martinworth had forgotten her so soon--so
soon! And yet, she thought, ought she to blame
him? Ought she not, instead of feeling this
sentiment of utter despondency, utter disgust, be
rejoicing that Martinworth by this step could
henceforth no longer be anything nearer to her
than an ordinary friend, an ordinary acquaintance?
She accused herself over and over again
for her inconsistency. She told herself that she
was absurd, illogical, unreasonable. Had she not
fled from this man--hidden herself from him--for
the express purpose that he should forget her?
Had she not advised him to marry some woman
who could show an honest front to the world, and
be a credit to him? And now that apparently
after some delay he had obeyed her injunctions,
what right had she to complain, to regret, to feel
angry and bitter, and to cavil against the inconstancy
of man?</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl's thoughts turned before long from herself
and Martinworth to the girl he had married. At
last she experienced the satisfaction of being able
to give full vent to her anger and disappointment.
To think that it was <i>she</i>--that it was Harry Joyce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
whom he had chosen as his wife out of all the
women of his world! That elderly young lady
whose whole soul was wrapped up in guns and
horses, in motor cars and rational costumes.
Harry Joyce, who never opened a book, and whose
newspaper and magazine reading was confined to
the racing calendar and to the sporting journals.
Harry of the strident voice and weather-beaten
countenance, whose ordinary way of greeting her
intimates of the opposite sex was to call them by
their nick-names, and to slap them on the back.
A woman who disregarded all the ordinary usages
of society, every outward form of conventionalism,
and yet, because she was the only daughter
of a Duke, was not only time after time forgiven,
but what was more, was accepted as a matter of
course, and in her frequent eccentricities was
never at a loss to find in either sex both followers
and admirers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps she has improved now, but she used
to be a horrible girl,&quot; exclaimed Pearl aloud, and
rising from her chair she paced up and down the
room. &quot;Dick always told me he detested her,
and was ashamed to acknowledge her as his cousin.
And to think of his committing the enormity of
marrying such a woman. He must be mad!
They haven't got a single idea in common. In
old days he cordially hated the emancipated
female. Some men of course find that sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
thing amusing. I have heard her called more
than once 'A capital fellow,' but imagine Dick,
my Dick, with such a wife! Imagine Dick uniting
his lot with 'A capital fellow!' Every word she
will utter, every action, every gesture, will grate on
his nerves--will horrify and disgust him. Oh,
what could have possessed him to ruin his life
by such an outrageous marriage?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For many days did Pearl ponder over this
problem, till at last she arrived at what was perhaps
more or less the right solution. Would she
have been human if, having decided in her own
mind the reason for this marriage, she did not at
the bottom of her heart feel a sneaking satisfaction
that the wife he had taken was after all the
masculine and unattractive Lady Harriet Joyce,
and not the sweet and innocent and beautiful maid
whom she herself had prescribed?</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, in spite of any slight comfort she
may have succeeded in deriving from this thought,
poor Pearl felt very sore and very forlorn, and
when a few days later Monsieur de Güldenfeldt
offered her his hand and his heart, she was more
than half inclined to yield to the temptation of
accepting a man who in positive terms assured
her of his love, and who could give her not only
a much-to-be-desired, but what was more, a safe
and tangible position.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas had, on the occasion referred to, accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
her in her ride, and they had stopped at a
little tea-house to rest themselves and their horses.
They wandered off on foot through a grove of
bamboos, and the conversation turning on Ralph
Nicholson's unexpected return to the country,
Pearl found herself speaking with considerable
feeling, of his constancy to her erratic young
cousin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless I have given him a piece of very
worldly and very wicked advice,&quot; she said with
her pretty laugh--&quot;I told him to get up a mild
flirtation with a married woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why married?&quot; asked de Güldenfeldt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because if he has no serious intentions, what's
the good of compromising a girl? Girls fall in
love so easily; whereas married women,&quot; she
added with a sigh, &quot;know so well how to look
after themselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Monsieur de Güldenfeldt did not reply for a
moment. Then he stopped in his walk, and
gazing at his companion, asked somewhat
gravely:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Nugent, are you quite sure that all married
women know so very well how to take care
of themselves?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think,&quot; answered Pearl in a low voice, &quot;if,
as I judge from your question you are thinking of
me, I really know pretty well how to look out for
myself. But then, of course my position is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
different from the majority of married women. I
am a sort of anomaly, and have had the sad
necessity of learning the lesson how to protect my
poor battered self. I confess, at times I have
found it a somewhat difficult task. But I feel
sure I have mastered it thoroughly now. It has
been a case of <i>force majeure</i>, you see.&quot; And
tears glistened in her eyes as she looked up at
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas de Güldenfeldt's heart swelled as,
glancing at this beautiful woman with the troubled
face, he thought of the unhappiness of her past
life, and of her present dignity and courage. He
stopped again, and seized hold of her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Nugent--Pearl,&quot; he said in a deep voice,
&quot;instead of for the future fighting your own
battles, dear, will you let me fight them for you?
Will you marry me? Will you let me have the
gratification of being in the blesséd position of
having the right to protect you? Of shielding
you from evil tongues, and of trying to render
you the happy woman you deserve to be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The colour flew into Pearl's cheeks, but she did
not withdraw her hands from his. She looked at
him, extreme astonishment depicted on her face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are asking me to marry you?&quot; she said,
&quot;you--you----?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes--I love you deeply, and my greatest
desire on earth is to make you my wife. Why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
should you be so surprised at that? Why,
Pearl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a minute Pearl looked down into the blue
eyes that, full of tenderness, were resting on her
face. She gazed at them as if trying to penetrate
their very depths. They were kind, true eyes,
she thought; but she withdrew her hands gently
from his, and turned away with a sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;I can never marry you. Oh!
that I could--that I could! Do you know,&quot; she
added hastily, without waiting for the reply that
she saw trembling on his lips, &quot;do you know,
Monsieur de Güldenfeldt, that I think you one
of the best, one of the most generous of men.
You are offering me everything. I, who can give
so little--nothing in return.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ask you for much: for your love, Pearl.
Will you not give it to me, dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl did not reply. Her thoughts travelled
as fast as the clouds above her. Why after all
should she not accept him? It was a brilliant
offer; an offer that a woman placed as she was
placed could never in her wildest dreams have
thought probable, or even possible. By marrying
de Güldenfeldt she was perfectly aware that her
position in society, which now hung on so delicate
a thread, would become regular and secure.
He knew her story. She had no inconvenient
confessions to make. He was evidently willing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
to take the risk of all future possible contingencies,
and of his love and tenderness and regard
she felt no doubt. Lord Martinworth would come
and would find her engaged, or married; and for
one brief moment Pearl experienced a glow of
satisfaction at the thought that her former lover
on his arrival, would find her, not pining or
regretting, not angry or dismayed, but in the
proud position of a happy and a triumphant
wife. But this thought was instantly crushed as
unworthy. She blushed to think she had ever
entertained it, and she told herself that the natural
grief, or <i>pique</i>, or whatever it was she felt in connection
with Lord Martinworth's marriage, must
have no influence on her present decision--must,
in no way whatsoever, affect that answer which
she knew she must give within the next few
minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">De Güldenfeldt was, she was well aware, a
clever and a good man; a man of a certain
present and of a brilliant future; a man that any
woman might be proud to call husband; and
here he stood, offering her--a poor waif and
stray in society--his love and his name. And yet
she felt that it was beyond her to accept these
gifts offered thus generously. Why? she hardly
asked herself. Was it because she still loved
Martinworth?--Perhaps--she could not tell. But
of one thing she felt convinced, she did not love,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
could never love, Stanislas de Güldenfeldt. She
admired and respected and liked him more than
she admired or liked most men. She delighted
in his society and in his conversation, which
was full of piquant anecdote, intellect and charm.
She felt absolutely contented, thoroughly at ease
in his companionship, which acted as a stimulant
in her otherwise somewhat monotonous life.
She did not disguise from herself for a moment
the many advantages she was renouncing in
setting aside this offer, and yet Pearl felt that
it was absolutely impossible for her to accept
him, for if she did she would she knew, be true
neither to de Güldenfeldt, whom she liked so well,
nor, above all, true to herself.</p>

<p class="indent">By this time the two were seated on a little
bamboo bench, and de Güldenfeldt, waiting and
watching with anxiety the expressive face, half
guessed and wholly feared the struggle that was
being fought within. He rose hurriedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't say anything, don't speak now,&quot; he exclaimed,
&quot;Wait, Pearl. Take your time to consider,
but remember, my darling--I may call you
so this once?--that my whole life's future, my
whole life's happiness, depends on your answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl felt greatly tempted to abide by this advice
and to delay. As he gave her this chance,
why commit herself by answering at once? But
her hesitation lasted only a minute. Her natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
candour and frankness of disposition warned her
it would be more than cowardly to postpone her
refusal. She turned towards him and said in her
low voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur de Güldenfeldt, it is best you should
know at once that which always must be known,
for I know my decision can never change. I fear it
is--it must be--'No.' I can never marry you. For
your own sake it must be so, for I do not love
you as you should--as you deserve to be loved.
My liking, my respect, my admiration is unbounded,
but love--forgive me for paining you--such
as I have known the word, is not, can never
be mine to give you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">De Güldenfeldt let his keen blue eyes rest for
a minute on Pearl's flushed face, then without
a single word in reply--with a quick, impatient
shrug of the shoulders--without a moment's
hesitation he turned and strode abruptly away.</p>

<p class="indent">Left by herself on the bench, Mrs. Nugent
watched this precipitate departure with considerable
dismay. She had seen and known the
Swedish Minister in many moods. Ironical, pensive,
bubbling over with good spirits one day,
melancholy and depressed the next, but, so far,
she never remembered having been a witness to
his anger. She gazed after him now with genuine
consternation, as he paced the little path with his
head thrown back, and his hands thrust well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
down into the pockets of his riding breeches.
Her spirits sank as the minutes passed, and he
finally disappeared from view. Eventually the
sentiment of trepidation that had at first seized her
changed to that of irritation and considerable
annoyance. After all, she thought, she had
answered him as gently as surely, in the circumstances,
it was possible to reply, and the more
she considered the question, the more did a feeling
of extreme vexation and surprise overcome
her at her refusal being received in this apparently
intensely angry and rebellious spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">Women at best are but unreasonable creatures,
and Mrs. Nugent was no exception to the rule,
forgetting to make allowances for the necessary
blow that such a prompt refusal must certainly
inflict on a man of Stanislas de Güldenfeldt's
proud and rather unyielding disposition. On
his side he was fully aware of the many and
great advantages of his offer, and of the sacrifices
on his part that such a marriage would entail.
It had by no means been fear of failure alone
that had prevented him from suggesting a connection
of a possibly too unbinding or temporary
nature. Since his final determination to make
this marriage, he had learnt that the great love he
bore Pearl would in itself, independent of any
other reason, be sufficient to cause him to reject
the former idea with promptitude and distaste.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
He did not however, disguise from himself that,
situated as she was, nine men out of ten would
have hesitated before offering her their name. He
himself had deliberated and paused before taking
this step, but having once, with complete disregard
of his future, proposed to give up all for her,
he found it impossible to recover from the mortification
that her abrupt rejection of his offer, and
the refusal for one moment even to consider his
proposal, had caused him.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas, greatly angered and deep in thought,
strode on and on. It was only the fact of unexpectedly
finding himself once more at the tea-house
that roused him from his vexatious thoughts,
recalling to him the fact of his hasty departure,
and unceremonious desertion of Pearl.</p>

<p class="indent">He then and there retraced his steps, and found
her where he had left her on the bench, with a
heightened colour, and a look of decided reproach
in her eyes. He was very pale as he lifted his
hat to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me for leaving you alone,&quot; he merely
said. &quot;Shall we return now. It is getting
chilly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl rose without a word. She followed
humbly, feeling somewhat like a naughty child
in disgrace. It was not long before her pride
rebelled against this sentiment, so unpleasantly
novel to her, and though her voice trembled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
and her throat felt rough and dry, she nerved
herself to break the prolonged and awkward
silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't think you are treating me very well,&quot;
she said rather defiantly. &quot;You did me the
honour to ask me a question, and I replied in the
only way that seemed possible to me. I can only
say I grieve if it was not the answer you appear
evidently to have expected.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Monsieur de Güldenfeldt did not speak. He
merely slowly raised his head, and with his
searching eyes gave Pearl one long and steadfast
look. This look had the unpleasant effect of
causing Mrs. Nugent to sincerely wish she had
bitten her tongue out sooner than have ventured
to break the silence.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Deep Waters.</span></p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas fled from Tokyo. He felt as if he
hated the place, as if he never wished to set foot in
it again. The evening of the day that Pearl
refused him he wrote to his Government requesting
leave to return home, but he worked almost
single-handed at his Legation, and he knew that it
would be impossible to take his departure until
someone had been sent out to relieve him, a circumstance
which meant many months of weary
waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">What might happen during those months he
found himself wondering, as he read over the
letter he had written so impetuously? A day, a
week might alter the whole chain of events, and
by the time his Government had given him permission
to take advantage of his leave, making all
arrangements to facilitate his departure, he knew
that it was more than possible that the idea of
throwing up his work and of leaving Japan would
be the last desire prominent in his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">Even in moments of the greatest excitement or
of distress, Stanislas--where the question of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
work was in any way involved--rarely acted
hastily or without looking at the question from all
sides. Thus in the present case, though it would
have been impossible for him to have explained
the exact reason why, after weighty consideration,
he ended by thrusting the hastily written letter into
a drawer, where it reposed peacefully until
destroyed many months later.</p>

<p class="indent">Not that at this moment De Güldenfeldt for
one second contemplated asking Mrs. Nugent a
second time to become his wife. No thought,
indeed, was further from his mind. After much
quiet deliberation, indeed considerable hesitation,
he had brought himself to the point of making
this offer, and greatly to his surprise, disappointment,
and distress, he had been refused. He was
deeply in love with Pearl, but it must be confessed
the sentiment for the moment that had the greatest
hold on the spirit of Stanislas de Güldenfeldt,
swamping all other feelings,--even for the time
being that of his love--was that of wounded
pride, Stanislas was by no means perfect, his
faults were many and manifold, and like all
those who from their earliest youth have
acted as their own masters--seldom having been
crossed in either whims or desires--he was extra-ordinarily
intolerant, even in small matters, of
the slightest contradiction or hindrance to his
wishes. But when it came to the point of renouncing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
what he most desired in life, not only
for the moment, but he knew well for all futurity,
Stanislas was consumed with what was far more
than a merely temporary sentiment of annoyance
and distress. A great astonishment, a permanent
anger and resentment filled his whole being, and
his one thought at the present moment was to fly
from Pearl and all associations of her, striving his
utmost to entirely banish from his mind the
woman who had so strangely upset his equanimity,
disarranging so completely his rather
settled habits and whole system of life.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus it was, travelling by slow stages and passing
his nights at clean and picturesque tea-houses
sleeping on <i>futon</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
 and eating the food of the
country, Stanislas, and the young interpreter of
his Legation, Suzuki, his sole companion in his
travels, one day found themselves at Sendai, from
which place they took the train to Shiogama.
There a <i>sampan</i>--the flat bottomed junk of the
Japanese--was engaged, and for several hours
Stanislas, stretched at the bottom of the boat, with
hands clasped behind his head, and eyes gazing
lazily up unto the unclouded sky above, glided in
and out through the thousands of lovely islands of
this archipelago, so full of mystery and of dreams.
Weird and wonderful were those islands, bays,
and promontories, in some cases beautiful and entrancing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
in their wealth of thick grown pines and
rich and varied vegetation, and in others, almost
uncanny in their bare, naked, volcanic rocks, worn
into strange patterns and fantastic shapes by the
inroads of the ever surging sea. Under the late
afternoon sun, and across this lovely limpid sea of
green, would fade far away in the distance vast
and misty ranges of thickly wooded hills, while
here and there, gleaming through the soft whiteness
of the light, a great peak of purple would
arise aloft like a beckoning finger, reaching far
beyond into the fast flying clouds of the faintly
shaded sky.</p>

<p class="indent">On reaching Matsushima (the &quot;Island of the
Pines&quot;) after this never-to-be-forgotten sail of
some delicious hours, and on arriving at the tea-house
perched on a rock high above the water,
that was to be his shelter for the night, de
Güldenfeldt, while the evening meal was being
prepared under the supervision of Suzuki, leaned
idly over the little barrier of the verandah. He
leant and gazed wonderingly at the beautiful scene,
till his whole soul was pervaded by the gentleness,
the dreamy passionlessness, the immense repose of
the solemn charm of the sight before him. The
musically rippling water, the many thousand islands,
the fading sun-set, with its great shafts of
glowing colour shooting across the sky, and merging
mysteriously into soft and subtle twilight--all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
had a peculiar beauty and character of their own.
It seemed to him like nothing he had ever seen before.
No old recollections, no old memories were
stirred to life as his eyes wandered over the
waters, and dwelt on the many thousand islands of
every form and size, now growing shapeless and
dim in the darkening shadows of the night.</p>

<p class="indent">And as he gazed thus, drinking in the beauty of
the scene and thinking of nothing--not even for
the moment of Pearl--and as the short twilight
gradually faded and night fell, Stanislas was the
witness of a strange and picturesque sight.</p>

<p class="indent">Thousands and thousands of dazzling lights
were shimmering on the surface of the dark calm
sea before him, each light growing gradually
fainter and fainter, and gliding further and further
away into the open. Then it was that de Güldenfeldt
remembered that it was the sacred and yearly
ceremony of the &quot;Shoryobune,&quot; or the launching
of the Ships of the Souls, when thousands of little
skiffs and barks, each illuminated with a single
lantern, are once a year set afloat upon the open
sea by the simple fisher-folk. On this date the
ocean is nought for the time being but one vast
highway of the Dead, whose passing souls must
cross the waters, be they rough or calm, to
eventually reach the haven of their distant and
Eternal Home.</p>

<p class="indent">Now gleaming on the crest of the wave, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
disappearing beneath the waters, those fires of the
Dead take their onward uncertain journey. Sad
indeed, is the fate of the lost lamenting soul,
whose little craft with its twinkling light is submerged
and extinguished by the scudding spray
of the sea, disappearing for ever from all human
sight and ken. For that poor struggling spirit
is no rest, nor eternal repose, forever and forever
will it be an outcast and a wanderer, hovering on
the shores of that Land in which Nirvâna is found,
but fated never to dwell within the regions of its
blessed calm and peace.</p>

<p class="indent">It is said that as these ghostly lights take their
strange and onward journey across the sea, the
distant murmur of many voices is heard like the
mournful roar of the surf beating on the strand,
the language uncomprehended and indistinguishable
of those many thousand weary souls,
struggling on towards their long prayed-for, long-expected
haven of peace and holy contemplation.</p>

<p class="indent">And as de Güldenfeldt gazed out thus far before
him, his eye became fixed upon one little glimmer,
dancing up and down on the water, and a cry
above the murmur of the many voices seemed to
him to come from the direction of that light.
Stanislas could not tear his eyes away from this
distant gleam, nor shut his ears to the sound of
that cry, so faint and weak, and yet so strangely
dominant over all other sounds around him. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
as he looked, fascinated and engrossed, the fancy
seized him that it was even at the spectacle of his
own striving weary soul he was gazing, and that
the wail that proceeded from that flickering light,
rising and falling across the waters, was the echo
of the cry of desolation and despair that had
filled and rent his heart, ever since the day he had
parted from Pearl Nugent in anger and bitter disillusion.
He leant further over the balcony, trying
to pierce the gloom and to follow the wind-fraught
vagaries of that one faint glimmering
light. Now it tore swiftly along, now it rose high
above the waves, seeming to challenge with its
swift and triumphant haste the more backward
competitors in this strenuous race, of which the
distant goal was the stormy and open sea.</p>

<p class="indent">It disappeared for the space of an instant, and
dreading that it was engulfed for ever by the
waters, Stanislas' heart sank within him. Ah!
no! there it was again, solitary and triumphant,
shining like a colossal diamond, far, far away--as
far as eye could see. Alone it was, reaching a
great distance beyond the others, and de Güldenfeldt
felt grieved for this flickering uncertain
light, always solitary, always struggling, however
much it was in advance, or appeared to
have vanquished those who had first started with
it in the race.</p>

<p class="indent">It was, therefore, with a certain glow of joy, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
sentiment of excitement, which he made no effort
to suppress, that he finally perceived another distant
light, yet as luminous and as steady as the
first, flying with all speed over the suddenly
roughening ocean, every instant approaching
nearer to the brilliant spark that for so long had
remained triumphantly mistress of the seas. Stanislas,
without hesitation, joyously decided in his
own mind that this second light could be none
other than the soul-light of Pearl, for as it gained
on the distant gleam the faint piteous cry that had
hitherto proceeded from the latter ceased, and the
light stood still on the face of the waters, and
Stanislas knew that his own expectant spirit was
waiting for Pearl's soul to join it. Swifter and
swifter it flew, nearer and nearer it came, gaining
every moment on that other trembling light that
was pausing on the crest of the wave to bear it
company on that rough and onward journey.
Stanislas felt assured that just one faint effort
more, one short critical moment, would join in
happy and eternal union these two distant lights.
But as he gazed breathlessly, the light which he
called Pearl's soul, for one brief second gleamed
up high into the horizon, gave a faint wavering
flicker, and the surface that an instant before was
all aglow with its vaporous brilliancy, grew as
dark as the inky night that so suddenly seemed
to envelope all things, and the little spark, engulfed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
by the waters, vanished for ever from all
human sight!</p>

<p class="indent">And there still remained his light, his soul,
solitary and forlorn, drifting aimlessly on and on.
Once again Stanislas caught the sound from far
across the waters of that moaning cry, that
piteous faint lament, the echo of the desolation
in his own heart; and the wail rang in his ears
till the light on the sea, growing smaller and smaller,
and fainter and fainter, finally merged into the
distant horizon, and was seen no more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder what is coming to me,&quot; sighed de
Güldenfeldt, as reluctantly stirring from the balcony,
he sat himself down on the pile of cushions
prepared for him on the <i>tatami</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
  &quot;I am as sentimental,
as great a fool as any boy indulging in
his first attack of calf-love. Yet--and yet--I
wish to God Pearl's light had not gone out, but
had succeeded in eventually reaching mine. It
would somehow have seemed more reassuring, a
better omen for the future, whereas now----&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas de Güldenfeldt passed a bad night.
The tea-house, famous for its lovely and extensive
view, but for little else, was by no means the
haven of rest he had hoped for. The celebration
of a <i>Geisha</i> feast in the next room, with all its
accompaniments of cheerful voices, rippling
laughter, and the doubtful charms of the music
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
of the <i>samisen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
 destroyed through the earlier
hours of the night all thoughts of repose. When
at length the last convivial guest, after many
<i>O'yasumi nasai</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
 had finally taken his departure,
Stanislas found to his cost that his <i>futon</i> were
both hard and lumpy, and that the Japanese green
mosquito net, perforated with holes, seemed expressly
fabricated to admit scores of those wily
and vicious insects, with which his tussles were
many and necessarily totally unsuccessful. He
tossed and turned, dozed for a few minutes, and
in his uneasy dreams was haunted by the soul-lights.
Now dancing on the waves, now taking
weird shapes of grotesque birds of prey, or fish
and animals of no known description, they
seemed to imperiously beckon him to join them,
or enveloping him in strange uncanny arms, they
dragged his struggling form far beneath the waters.
Finally he no longer could support in patience
the discomfort of his room or these weird nightmares
of an excited brain, and rising from his
lowly couch and pushing open the <i>amado</i>,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
 he

which the islands rose from out the water like
great gaps blackened by mysterious and ever-moving

the consecrated ground. Not a living creature
was to be seen, and with the exception of the hum
of the night insects, all was as silent as the aged
moss-grown tombstones on which the moonbeams
fell in ghostly streaks of light.</p>

<p class="indent">This simple verse was the composition of the
English mother he had adored, and the repetition
of it, so appropriate to the sweet scene before
Stanislas' eyes, tended greatly towards bestowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
that repose which till now had eluded his weary
yet restless mind.</p>

<p class="indent">But the beauty and peace and silence were not
to last. A shadow fell across the surface of the
moon, and a fitful and mysterious wind wailed
from behind the hills. Suddenly, with no previous
warning, every cur in every little hamlet
from far and near commenced a discordant and
incessant barking. Before Stanislas could ask
himself what meant this unwelcomed disturbance
of the calm night, a premonitory trembling of the
wooden verandah on which he stood warned him
that all the terrors of an earthquake were before
him. There was no time to realise this disagreeable
fact before another shock followed the first,
more violent and more prolonged, then a third,
in which the wood creaking, rose like the waves
of the ocean from beneath his feet. Stanislas
found himself clinging to the bamboo rails of the
verandah, watching with a strange fascination
the branches of the sacred cedar waving violently
backwards and forwards as if shaken by the force
of a tempest, and the red <i>torii</i> beyond, trembling
in its balance. The shock continued, each
second increasing the violence thereof, till, with
a deafening roar, like the roar of the ocean, with
one stupendous and prolonged crash, the frail
building, sliding from its slight foundations, collapsed
like a house of cards! Stanislas remembered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
no more until he found himself stretched on the
ground outside all that now remained of the once
picturesque tea-house. A few yards further and he
would have been over the cliff. As it was, he was
on his feet in a moment, feeling none the worse
for his fall, which had been from no great height,
and was broken by the heap of stones and rubbish
on which he fell.</p>

<p class="indent">The house was a mass of ruins. Such indeed,
as soon as his somewhat dazed condition allowed
him to look around him, seemed to be the melancholy
condition of most of the miniature matchbox
habitations that three minutes before had
stood edging the sea in all their simple and
romantic beauty. The <i>torii</i> that he had admired
so short a time ago bathed in the calm moonlight,
now lay prone on the ground, while half the roof
of the little shrine had vanished in a cloud of dust.
Only remained the great and ancient cedar to
compete against and triumphantly conquer many
another revolution of angry nature. This noble
tree had survived hundreds of years of earth oscillations
and currents, tidal waves and earthquakes,
volcanic agencies to which we are told Japan itself
owes her very being. Doubtless to the same
terrible and disastrous causes, perhaps to-day, perhaps
to-morrow, perhaps only in the far distant
ages to come, will this beautiful fairyland owe
her ultimate destruction.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
Güldenfeldt's first thought in the chaos that
followed was of his young interpreter Suzuki.
He shouted his name aloud, but in the din and
confusion and the chorus of wails and weepings
over lost property--and, alas! in many cases, lost
dear ones--his voice was unheard. He knew the
boy had been sleeping in the room next to his
own, but that little room was now with the rest
of the building, heaped on the ground a mass of
ruins. Calling on some of the fishermen who
were standing by him stupefied by the scene of
bitter desolation before them--he tore wildly at
the <i>débris</i> of planks and paper and matting piled
on the ground, feeling sure that he had but to
persevere long enough to find him for whom he
searched. In far too short a space of time in lifting
a heavy beam of wood, the body of this dear
companion of his travels was discovered beneath,
motionless and dead. From the first indeed, a
presentiment of coming evil had warned Stanislas
he would thus find him. The moon, once more
unclouded and brilliant, lit up the boy's good-looking
face and slim young form. Still resting on
his <i>futon</i> there was an expression of such complete
peace and happiness on his countenance
that for a moment it was indeed difficult not to
consider as merely slumbering, this youth hurled
thus suddenly into eternity.</p>

<p class="indent">De Güldenfeldt raised the burden, so light and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
delicate in his arms, and pushing away the dark
hair from the brow he perceived a deep jagged
cut on the temple. That wound in itself was
enough to cause instant death. The blood had
ceased to flow with the ceasing of the heart-throbs,
and as his eyes lingered sadly on the inanimate
form within his arm, the tears welled
up into de Güldenfeldt's eyes. He had loved this
young man born at the Legation, and educated
at the French school, the worthy son of a noble
Samurai, who himself after the Revolution and on
the loss of his fortune, had in years gone-by, been
only too grateful to accept the situation of Interpreter
at the Swedish Legation. From the
first day that Stanislas had held the post of
Minister in Japan, this youth, unusually quick and
intelligent, had proved not only his companion,
but his right hand. He had returned the affection
of his master with the fidelity and devotion of his
race, had accompanied him in his many travels
throughout the country, was an excellent interpreter,
and had directed his household with the
thoroughness and conscientiousness of an upright
and honest man, devoted to his master's
interests.</p>

<p class="indent">De Güldenfeldt felt that in losing this bright
and intelligent companion of many lonely hours,
he was losing half himself. &quot;One shall be taken
and the other left,&quot; he murmured, as unrestrained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
the tears fell. &quot;Indeed the ways of Providence
are strange. Why has this lad, so full of promise
and with all before him, been the one taken,
while I, a lonely man, with no hold on life, no
ties, no inducements to keep me here--am the
unfortunate one that is left?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And the next day during the sad process of
cremation, when, after three brief hours, all that
was left of this charming companion of years
was a handful of ashes and a few splinters of
bone, Stanislas, with a feeling of intense loss and
desolation, again asked himself that question. Why
was he the one whom Providence had chosen to
continue the strife?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No one cares for me, no one wants me,&quot; he
thought, as he sadly supervised the placing of the
ashes in the urn.</p>

<p class="indent">And to this day those ashes repose, and have
incense and flowers offered before them in the
grounds of the great Temple of the <i>Koya San</i>.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER V.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Home News.</span></p>

<p class="indent">While de Güldenfeldt was pursuing his travels,
a prey to morbid thoughts increased by this tragic
event which had touched him so nearly, and
while he was trying to learn that hardest lesson
in the world--the lesson to forget, or in his
weaker moments, for man is but human after
all, dreaming dreams and weaving fancies, dangerous
and alluring, Pearl, the chief cause of his
depression, yet the subject of those heavenly
dreams and fancies, was pursuing the even tenour
of her way in Tokyo.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl likewise had passed through her moments
of weakness and regret. There were times, indeed,
when she arrived at the somewhat humiliating
conclusion that, considering all things,
there was not much to choose between her
manner of acting and that of the foolish girl
whom she had taken it upon herself so severely to
lecture.</p>

<p class="indent">She and her young cousin were much in each
other's society at this time, the mere fact of both
being placed in fairly similar positions, helping,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
perhaps to strengthen the tie of kinship, and that
of their mutual affection one for the other.</p>

<p class="indent">It was during one of their early morning rides
that Mrs. Nugent told Amy of de Güldenfeldt's
offer, of her rejection thereof, and of the Swedish
Minister's consequent irritation and final disappearance
from the centre of operations.</p>

<p class="indent">At this information confided to her, a mischievous
gleam sparkled from Miss Mendovy's
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really, my dear Pearl,&quot; she said, very fairly
imitating her cousin's voice and manner, &quot;I must
speak seriously to you. How could you have
been so foolish as to have treated Monsieur de
Güldenfeldt as if he were a mere boy? I have no
patience with you, Pearl. You forget that the
Swedish Minister is a man in a thousand,--a delightful
man, a clever man, and from a worldly
point of view an excellent match, etc., etc., etc.
Don't you think, my dear,&quot; she added, turning
round in her saddle, and glancing at Pearl with a
face brimming over with laughter, &quot;don't you
think that these, your own words remember,
addressed no doubt perfectly justly to your erring
but I assure you long-ago-repentant cousin, might
apply most admirably in your own case? It is
rather a pity you were so 'previous,' I think,
wasting your breath on me, instead of reserving it
for your own delinquencies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
&quot;It seems to me,&quot; replied Pearl, as she gave a
little flick to her mare, &quot;that you in your eloquence,
Miss Amy, are forgetting one vital difference
in the two cases. Whereas you, by your
own confession, are in love with Sir Ralph
Nicholson, and what is more, have been in this
blissful condition for ages, I have no feeling for
Monsieur de Güldenfeldt but that of great liking
and the very deepest admiration for his cleverness
and wit. This rather alters the situation, don't
you think, you extremely sarcastic and facetious
young person?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, love!&quot; ejaculated Amy with uptilted
nose, &quot;pray who thinks nowadays of such an
out-of-date sentiment as love? What is love,
compared to the advantages of a profitable marriage?
Besides, Pearl, if you are not in love with
him, you ought to be. He's a dear man, and you
have recklessly and deliberately thrown away an
excellent chance. And for what? An idea, a
mere antiquated worn-out idea. And that's a fact,
so it is no use trying to make out the contrary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are doubtless right, Amy, perfectly right,&quot;
answered Pearl in an unusually humble voice, &quot;I
know I am never likely to get such a chance
again. Considering my position, it was a stroke
of luck I had no right to expect, and yet--and
yet--My dear Amy, it comes to this, it's no use
talking to a girl like you. You've never been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
married, so how can you in the least realize what
marriage means? I know, to my cost, only too
well what it entails. So is it to be wondered at
that I hesitate before making a second venture,
however advisable to your inexperienced eyes such
a marriage may seem?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They trotted on in silence for some minutes,
then Amy replied somewhat dubiously,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right, Pearl. Of course I can't in the
least know the consequences, good or bad, of
matrimony. What is more, as far as I can see, I
am never likely to have the chance of finding out.
For I am decided on one point--nobody but
Ralph shall have the honour of calling me wife,
an honour which, so far, that young man seems
in no hurry whatsoever to burden himself with.
It is ages and ages since he condescended to
come near me. And when by chance, once in a
blue moon, we do happen to meet, His Excellency
as a rule is far too occupied with some
other fascinating member of the fair sex to
think it worth his while to hardly cast me a glance
of recognition. Rather different from the old
days, eh, Pearl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You brought it on yourself, my dear cousin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I confess, Pearl, I have hitherto looked upon
you as a fairly intelligent woman. Another lost
illusion, I suppose. Pray, how does the fact of
my having brought this state of things on myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
in the least alter or improve matters? Bother the
men! Don't let's talk any more about them.
The world would certainly be far jollier if they
didn't exist. I see,&quot; she added with a serio-comic
twinkle in her eye, &quot;there is only one thing left
for me to do, and that is to pray that Sir Ralph's
ultimate fate in the shape of a wife may be a
shrew, the plague of his life, someone who will
lead him a nice dance in fact. Then perhaps
he may feel inclined to indulge in some moments
of regret that he did not stick a little longer to
dear, amiable, sweet-tempered Amy Mendovy.
Come along, Pearl, let's have a canter, and for
one brief moment forget that disagreeable appendage--man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Amy was not fated to be in luck that morning,
for shortly afterwards a sharp turn in the
road brought the two ladies face to face with
that particular &quot;appendage&quot; who was evidently
engrossing Miss Mendovy's thoughts. Ralph was
accompanied by two extremely pretty girls, all
three on horseback, and apparently, from their
peals of happy laughter, in the highest of spirits
and the greatest good humour with themselves
and the world in general.</p>

<p class="indent">Amy Mendovy flushed crimson, and with a
bow that included the whole party, she gave a
cut to her pony, and trotted quickly on, while
Pearl, calling out to one of the girls, &quot;I hope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
you have had a nice ride this lovely morning,
Eulalie,&quot; followed after her cousin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you not stop, Amy?&quot; she asked as
she caught her up. &quot;The de Bourvilles reined in
their horses with the intention of having a chat.
They looked so astonished and annoyed when
you went tearing past them in that strange, erratic
manner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you find the society of those girls so fascinating,
my dear, why did you pay any attention to
my movements, and not stop yourself?&quot; replied
Amy sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had to follow you. If I had not done so it
would have made your behaviour appear still
more markedly rude,&quot; answered Pearl quietly.
&quot;As it is, they may possibly attribute our tearing
past them in that extraordinary manner, to some
real necessity for haste.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I really don't in the least care what they think.
The opinions of the Mesdemoiselles de Bourville
never have interested me, nor will they ever interest
me in the very slightest degree. The only thing that
distresses me somewhat is to see two unfortunate
girls, neither of whom have the vaguest notion of
sitting a horse, attempting to ride.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you see, they are merely beginners.
No doubt as they go out now so often with Sir
Ralph he will soon teach them to sit straight,&quot;
replied Pearl rather maliciously. &quot;They've got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
nice figures, and are both adorably pretty. I'm
sure their habits are English made.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doubtless,&quot; said Amy, with a slight drawl,
which she affected when she wished to appear
bored, &quot;but really their riding habits excite me
as little as the owners themselves. Do let us talk
of something more interesting, Pearl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl smiled quietly to herself as she thought,
with a certain satisfaction, how quickly the remedy
which she herself had prescribed was working on
the all-unconscious patient. &quot;I have never seen
Amy in such a temper, or heard her use such an
unpleasant tone towards other girls before,&quot; she
thought. &quot;Poor child! She's green with jealousy.
No wonder! when in the old days there
was never a question of Ralph riding with anyone
but herself. Dear, wise Ralph! if only you
continue to play your cards as well as you have
started, there's no reason whatsoever, knowing my
fair cousin as I do, but that you will be married
to her whenever you choose to fix the day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That same morning, on her return from her
ride, Pearl found she was likely to have far more
serious matters than Amy's affairs of the heart to
occupy her mind.</p>

<p class="indent">The mail had come in, an event that ordinarily
did not greatly excite Mrs. Nugent. Having
shut herself off from all old associations, all
former connections, she seldom, with the exception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
of an occasional communication from her
banker or lawyer, received much of interest by
the post, the pile of newspapers and magazines,
despatched to her weekly, being her sole and
only means of keeping in touch with the outer
world.</p>

<p class="indent">But this morning, on entering her cosy little
boudoir, one glance at the writing table showed,
lying in a prominent place, a couple of letters, one
from Mr. Hall and the other in a former well-known
and altogether dreaded handwriting. No
need to lift the letter from the table to recognize
only too well the once familiar, but now almost
forgotten writing of the husband whom she had
divorced. On perceiving it she made an exclamation
of dismay, for a moment hesitating whether
she should not destroy unread this unexpected
and most unwelcome missive. Nevertheless,
though vexed and irritated, the sight of the letter
aroused no keen feelings in her mind. Since she
had freed herself from him, the writer himself
had grown so completely indifferent--belonging
so entirely to that black chapter of the past,
which, until reopened by Nicholson, she had
flattered herself was closed for ever--that she
felt, whatever he might elect to write, whatever
insults, whatever injuries might be addressed to
her in this letter, no sentiment but that of a sort
of dreary contempt, a partial and temporary irritation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
unworthy even of the name of anger, was
now capable of being once more stirred to life.</p>

<p class="indent">Indifference to vituperation did not however,
carry her so far as to swamp all natural feelings
of curiosity, and when, after a few moments of
deliberation, she lifted the letter by the corner,
she examined the envelope with a certain interest
and wonder. The letter was fully directed to
her present name and address, a fact which, on
consideration, caused an incipient fear, and certainly
unbounded astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">So he knew not only of her change of name,
but of her whereabouts, by what occult means
she did not wait to consider, but delaying no
longer, Pearl hastily opened the epistle, and read
the following contents:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Pearl,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not for one moment flatter myself
that it is likely you should take the smallest
interest in the fate of the man who once
called himself your husband. As, however,
I am informed that surely--and I am
personally convinced by no means slowly--my
days are numbered, I am writing before
the breath vanishes for ever from this poor
suffering body, to make, entirely for my own
satisfaction, a certain communication to
you.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am leaving you--for reasons which it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
hardly necessary for me to enumerate--the
complete mistress of my fortune. For fear,
however, that you should be deluded into
the belief that this proceeding is an act of,
what you might be pleased to consider
reparation on my part, I wish before the end
comes, to entirely disabuse your mind of
that fallacy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am a dying man, it is true, but a worn out
carcass does not necessarily entail a
clouded or impaired intelligence. My
mind, believe me, is as clear as when you
knew me, and I solemnly here announce on
my death-bed a fact, which except in public
you have heretofore never given me the
chance of declaring, that in my marital
relations, I was as deeply wronged, as you
no doubt are perfectly justified in considering
I wronged you.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You obtained your divorce by the breadth
of a hair, you will doubtless remember.
The fact that after having achieved
your ends no marriage with Martinworth
took place, did not for one
instant throw dust in my eyes, whatever
may have been the effect on that individual
himself, or on the many, who at that time,
called themselves your friends. I repeat,
that for many years I possessed the positive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
conviction that Martinworth was your lover.
In no wise did this fact interfere with me
or my plans. Indeed, the knowledge that
you were agreeably occupied entirely suited
my book, and under the circumstances I
found it a natural and convenient arrangement
for all parties concerned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If, my dear Pearl, you had only shown
that cleverness which you had exhibited for
so many years, and if instead of dragging me
into the Divorce Court you had been satisfied
to let well alone, we should have continued
a comfortable <i>ménage à trois</i> till the
end of the chapter. That chapter, as far
as I am concerned, would soon have closed,
and in three or four years' time you would
have found yourself, while still fairly young
and extremely handsome, playing the satisfactory
and the justifiable <i>rôle</i> of the
bereaved, but by no means inconsolable
widow. That awkward impediment the
husband, having been conveniently disposed
of underground, no stumbling block
would have stood in the way of legalizing
your position, by a marriage at some fashionable
church, to which interesting ceremony
lustre would have been added by the
presence, no doubt, of the smartest set in
Town.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
&quot;But you were too hasty in your desire to
cast off your shackles. Seeing, however,
the precious little use you have made of
your freedom, is it to be wondered at that
my breath should have been taken away
by such an exhibition of complete <i>manque
de savoir faire</i>. By one, too, whom, when
I gave myself the trouble to think about
her at all, I certainly considered possessed
that quality to perfection.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What? I ask you, have you gained by
this most ill-advised step, on the taking of
which, if you had only consulted me, I
should most certainly, for your own sake,
have counselled you against? Have you
achieved liberty of action? Certainly not.
Before your divorce you were completely
free. A firmer and less compromising stand
in society? Hardly, you must allow, considering
the many doubtful and unpleasant
incidents of your life, that to shield my own
reputation my counsel had to bring to light.
Undisturbed union with your lover? Your
own subsequent and most inexplicable behaviour
forfeited for ever all chance of such
a future.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, in the place of gain, compare your
losses. Exile from your native land. The
loss of the protection of your husband's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
name. The loss of the constant companionship
of an adoring lover, and while
you were my wife, however much you
might have thought fit to scorn that position,
the loss of a tangible and by no
means insignificant place in that society,
which for over ten years had been to you
as the very breath of your nostrils.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! poor, blind, benighted fool! I
cannot but pity you, Pearl, my rage and
spite having long ago exhausted themselves.
It is to prove to you this truth, namely, that
I have no bitterness, no rancour, that I am
acting as I do, leaving you the complete
controller of that fortune, which, from the
fact of you having shared it for so many
years, you well know is by no means inconsiderable.
Do as you will with it. As you
will see, it is yours without conditions. You
in your turn can leave this wealth to whom
you desire, my own few distant relatives
having no claim whatsoever upon me.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One word more before I close these
lines.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Once, being no longer master of my
actions, I was so unfortunate as to strike
you. It was principally on the fact of that
blow that you obtained your divorce. I
apologise to you for this deed. I can only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
add that, whatever the provocation, I
should never have acted thus in my sober
moments.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, adieu. By the time you
receive this I shall, in all probability be
beneath the sod. No doubt you will experience
a certain natural satisfaction in feeling
assured that for the future you no longer
can be troubled by</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Guy Norrywood</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Pearl stood for a long time with this letter
clasped tightly in her hand, a prey to strangely
mixed feelings. Though, during all the years they
had spent together, Norrywood had evidently not
considered it worth his while to express his
opinion, she nevertheless had by no means been
in ignorance of her husband's true sentiments
towards her. Before the crash she in her turn, had
scorned to confute or to argue this opinion,
though if she had for a moment supposed that
every questionable position, every compromising
action on her part was to have been brought
as evidence against her in her own suit, she certainly
would have taken more pains in those early
days, even to the man whom she despised so
thoroughly, to have explained and proved her
innocence. But neither she, nor Martinworth,
nor her Counsel had for one moment contemplated
such a step on Norrywood's part, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
indeed at one time it was believed the case would
proceed in its course undefended. Judge then of
her astonishment when her husband appeared in
Court armed with these many powerful, aye!
deadly weapons against her. Too late then to
explain or temporize, and Pearl in bitterness of
spirit realised fully her egregious folly in having
from the very commencement so completely
scorned, so entirely despised her foe.</p>

<p class="indent">Bitter memories were aroused in Mrs. Nugent's
breast by the perusal of this letter--memories and
regrets and rage that long had remained dormant,
so much so, that she asked herself whether after
all, her philosophy was beginning to play her
false. But Norrywood's unvarnished opinion of
her, the complete cynicism of his plain speaking,
the crude bluntness, brutality indeed, of his well weighed
and deliberate conclusions touched her
not at all. She had all along been aware of his
opinion, and to some extent she could comprehend
his having arrived at such an unflattering
conclusion, and almost forgave him for it. She
felt, however, a slight regret that he should have
died unchanged in this belief, especially as on the
whole the letter aroused her sympathies, and a
vague feeling of pity in her breast. She read
between the lines, and in spite of his refutation
of the same, she knew that this will in her favour
was an act of reparation--tardy amends for all he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
had made her suffer during his lifetime. The
act, if not the words, confessed remorse. Such
being the case, and with this barrier of the tomb
between them, she felt that she could forgive him
much. She had never for one instant contemplated
the possibility of inheriting his money.
She did not wish for it, and as she restored the
letter to the envelope she deluded herself with the
belief that no power on earth could force her to
accept this undesired, this unexpected gift.</p>

<p class="indent">But there was still Mr. Hall's letter to be read.
It was, she perceived, dated ten days later than
that of her husband, and contained the contents
of his will and the details of his miserable death,
which had taken place suddenly a few days after
the writing of this last long epistle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Your former husband,&quot; wrote Mr. Hall,
&quot;has for the last year been suffering from an
extremely painful, and from the first, incurable
disease. I was surprised that I, and
not his own lawyer, should be called in to
draw up his last will and testament, but his
reasons for this act were later on, explained.
I was touched by the great change I perceived
in the poor sufferer's whole character
and demeanour, and though nothing I
could say would induce him to change his
opinion on one point,--namely, as to your
relations with Lord Martinworth,--the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
approach of Death, that great Softener, had
melted the hitherto stony heart, and he
spoke gently and kindly of you, and with a
genuine regret for the constant sorrow of
which he had been the cause. Mr. Norrywood's
standard of morals, as we know to
our cost, was at no times a high one. Presumably
it was owing to this fact that he
appeared to think the intimacy, which to
the last he insisted existed between you
and his lordship, was not otherwise than
natural, and by no means blamable under
the circumstances of his own acknowledged
infidelity to you. But what seemed
to astonish him beyond words was the
fact of your having gone to the length
of putting him into Court at all. He
told me he wished, before he died, to
express what he had so far never had an
opportunity of doing, his opinion of your
folly in taking this step. 'Naturally I had
to defend myself,' he said, 'and the consequences
have been my wife's social ruin.'
He said much more on this point, and
concluded by asking for your address for
the purpose--he told me--of expressing his
sentiments, and of informing you of his
monetary intentions towards you.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Considering it was the request of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
dying man, I felt--in spite of your strict
injunctions to the contrary, and consequently
certain qualms of conscience on
my part--that the only thing I could do in
the circumstances was to accede to his request.
I therefore wrote down for him
your present name and address, and I can
only trust, my dear young friend, that Mr.
Norrywood, in this his last letter to you,
confined himself to facts, inscribing
nothing of a particularly unkind or painful
nature.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will see by the enclosed copy of
the will that Mr. Norrywood has left you a
very wealthy woman. However distasteful
the source may be from which the money
springs, remember, my child, that much
good can be done with this large fortune,
of which you are left complete mistress,
now and for the future. Knowing you as I
do, I am convinced that your first impulse
will be to refuse this wealth. But I also
believe that on impartial and thoughtful
consideration you will understand the immense
folly of such a step. Indeed, a great
portion of it having been settled on you at
your marriage, must be yours in any case.
So do not act hastily, but remember that in
years to come there may be others besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
yourself who can be benefited by these
large sums.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should much like to know your intentions
as to the future. Have you any
thoughts of returning home? Your absence
has been a long one. The persons that you
dreaded are removed from your path--one
by death and the other by marriage.
It is therefore hardly necessary for me to
point out that on inheriting this fortune
your presence, for a short period at least in
your native land, is highly desirable, I may
even add, necessary.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Mr. Hall concluded his letter with various
business details as to investments, etc., also with
much fatherly and kind advice, which he considered
it his duty to offer, but which no one knew
better than he himself was more likely to be
ignored than followed.

Pearl, with puckered brow, was still standing by
her writing table, pondering over these momentous
and upsetting communications, when a
<i>'ricksha</i> rattled up to the door, and a moment
later Mrs. Rawlinson was in the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dearest Rosina,&quot; exclaimed Pearl as she embraced
her cousin, &quot;what a wonderful woman
you are! You have the blessèd knack of always
appearing on the spot when most needed. I was
wishing for you so much, and was just contemplating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
ordering the carriage and driving round
to Azabu.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's the matter now?&quot; enquired Mrs.
Rawlinson, as she glanced at the two letters in
Pearl's hand with a certain alarm in her brown
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want you to read these letters brought by
this morning's mail. No, this one first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosina took Mr. Norrywood's letter handed to
her, and walking to the window stood with her
back to Mrs. Nugent. She read it straight through,
and until she had replaced it in the envelope
made no remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I suppose, judging from what he writes
of his condition, the poor man must be dead by
this time,&quot; and Rosina's cheerful voice as she
turned round contrasted rather ludicrously with
the <i>figure de circonstance</i> conjured up for the
occasion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Pearl quietly, &quot;he is dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's no use humbugging, and pretending one
is sorry when one isn't,&quot; retorted Mrs. Rawlinson.
&quot;To put it mildly, Pearl, that man's death is--is--what
shall we say? Well, let us call it a merciful
release. That's an expression that can hurt no
one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's done me no harm for some years, and
time softens things,&quot; replied Pearl gently. &quot;I
think, too, he was perhaps sorry at the last.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
&quot;Hum! death-bed repentance,&quot; said Mrs.
Rawlinson drily. &quot;I've not much faith in that
sort of thing myself. So easy to say you are
sorry when circumstances over which you have
no control make it impossible for you to have the
chance of doing further harm. At any rate, I am
glad to see that his repentance--if repentance it
was--took a tangible form, and that in dying he
had the decency to make certain amends for his
disgraceful conduct towards you during his lifetime.
You'll be a rich woman, Pearl. Let us
trust, dear, that you will make better use of the
money than he did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Pearl, &quot;I shall be rich, very rich, if
I accept the money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If--what?&quot; and Rosina stared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I accept Mr. Norrywood's money,&quot; repeated
Pearl. &quot;I have by no means decided to do
so, Rosina.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you mad?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not that I am aware of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Pearl,&quot; and Mrs. Rawlinson settled
herself squarely in an arm chair, &quot;I shall not
even give myself the trouble of demanding your
reasons for this totally absurd, ridiculously
quixotic hesitation on your part.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Such being the case,&quot; retorted Pearl with a
slight flush, &quot;I shall likewise, greatly to my
relief, be exempted from the trouble of informing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
you of them. Nevertheless I am, I confess,
somewhat disappointed, for I flattered myself that
you at least, Rosina, would have understood my
motives--my--well--my scruples on this point.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, I don't, and that's a fact,&quot; replied
her cousin tersely. &quot;The man, as all the world
knows, treated you shamefully, made your life a
misery from the very commencement. After
putting up for years not only with neglect and
infidelity, but with downright cruelty, you had the
strength of mind to appeal to the law, and to
divorce him. He is dying, and he writes you a
letter. And even on his death-bed he cannot resist
insulting you--accusing you of various disgraceful
and altogether impossible actions. He has
however, enough decency left in his composition
to apologise for one of the many hundreds of his
villainous acts, and, above all, he makes a certain
reparation by leaving you his fortune. After all,
my dear Pearl, a large portion of that fortune is
already yours. He made excellent settlements, I
remember, and you have been profiting by the
interest of that sum ever since you left him. I
really can't see the difference if, instead of a portion--the
quarter, the half, whatever has hitherto
been yours--you should for the future take over
the whole of the fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl was silent. Rosina's calm unemotional
manner of regarding matters always influenced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
her more impulsive and excitable nature. She
felt there was much good sense and wisdom in
what her cousin said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You seem to be of the same opinion as Mr.
Hall,&quot; she said, after a minute. &quot;He thinks I
ought to keep the money. You will see what he
says in this letter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is a good friend to you, Pearl, that old
lawyer,&quot; remarked Mrs. Rawlinson, as after carefully
reading the letter, she returned it to Mrs.
Nugent. &quot;I can only impress on you to follow
his and my advice. Above all, don't act in a hurry.
What do you intend to do about going home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! spare me, Rosina! Why, I have only
just received these letters. I haven't thought of
making plans. But who knows? If my presence
in England is really necessary for business purposes,
I may possibly take a trip home after the
summer. But my absence will be only temporary.
I shall return. While you are here, Rosina dear,
Japan will always be my home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well! there might be worse places,&quot; and
Mrs. Rawlinson pulled down her veil, preparatory
to departure, &quot;in spite of slight drawbacks
in the way of distance, typhoons, earthquakes,
etc. By the way, I wanted to telephone to you
on Wednesday after that awful shock, but the
wires were disarranged. Were you frightened?
Did you suffer much loss?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
&quot;Several of my best pieces of Imari china were
smashed,&quot; replied Pearl, &quot;and I picked up my
big Delft vase in fear and trembling. But it was
uninjured, mercifully. Stranger still, this heavy
bronze clock was thrown off the mantelpiece, and
was still going when I picked it up. Frightened?
I should think I was frightened. I and all the
Japanese servants rushed into the garden, and
watched the house rocking backwards and
forwards, expecting every moment to see it
collapse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was the worst earthquake we've had for
years,&quot; added Rosina, &quot;but it was nothing here
compared to what it was in the north. I see by
the newspapers whole villages were destroyed, and
there has been immense loss of life. Amy will
have told you how Tom retired as usual under the
table. And did you hear how those two American
globe-trotters, those dear old Miss Mordants, each
clutching her own particular Chin dog, fled precipitately
from the Grand Hotel, clad in little else
than their stockings and chemises, and took
refuge in a <i>'ricksha</i> in the middle of the Bund?
Thus airily clad, with the hood down and the
apron up, they insisted on remaining for several
hours. And then poor Nelly Richards, who was
completely lost, and at last, after a long search,
was found up a tree in the garden. I am told no
power in heaven or earth would induce her to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
desert her tree until dragged down by main force
by her infuriated parent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, even earthquakes have their comical side.
I heard of a certain mutual friend of ours who
was indulging in a bath at that moment, and who
fled into the street adorned tastefully but extremely
simply in a high hat and a walking-stick,&quot;
and Pearl laughed, but a second later her face
became once more overclouded, and she sighed
deeply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now my dear,&quot; said Rosina, as she took her
in her arms and kissed her affectionately, &quot;be
your own brave philosophical self, and don't
worry about things. And as for your late husband,
the last thing you could possibly manage
to do is to mourn him, you know. Personally,
I make no attempt to disguise how greatly relieved
I am that a merciful Providence has thought fit to
remove him from this troublesome world to
another, and,--we'll hope,--a brighter sphere.
While he was alive, in spite of your divorce, one
could never feel quite sure that he might not take
it into that evil head of his to annoy you in some
way. Why! who knows? He might have turned
up here in Tokyo!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There may be, for all you think, a far worse
danger threatening me than the unexpected
arrival of a divorced husband,&quot; murmured Pearl
oracularly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
She was on the verge of confiding to Rosina the
probable arrival in Japan of Lord Martinworth.
She would have done so if it had not been that,
since those few confidential conversations held on
Pearl's first arrival three years ago, the name and
even the existence of Martinworth had, by a sort
of tacit consent and mutual understanding, been
ignored by the two women in all later intercourse.
Pearl was longing for Rosina's sympathy and advice
in the difficulties she saw before her, but an
incipient feeling of shyness, a kind of <i>mauvaise
honte</i>, prevented her from venturing to reopen a
subject which for so long had been closed between
them. She therefore held her peace.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After all,&quot; she thought, as she seated herself
at her writing table after Mrs. Rawlinson's departure,
&quot;it may simply be a mare's nest of Sir
Ralph's. Dick may never come in the end. A
thousand incidents may occur to cause him to
change his mind. And even if he and his wife do
come to Japan, it is just as likely we shall not
meet. What scores of globe-trotters visit this
country whom I never see. I can easily abstain
for the next two or three months from accepting
invitations to the English Legation, the one place
where we are likely to run across each other. Yes,
after all, I am glad I said nothing to Rosina.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And yet in spite of all her sophistries, deep
down in her heart of hearts, Pearl never doubted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
for a moment but that it was ordained by fate that
Dick Martinworth should visit Japan, and that
once again, whether for weal or for woe she knew
not, their paths in life should cross.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Hall's and Rosina's arguments combined
carried weight, and the next mail conveyed a
letter from Mrs. Nugent to the former, in which
no mention was made of renouncing the wealth
left her. Indeed, enclosed with the letter was the
rough draft of a will, by which, with the exception
of a very substantial legacy to Mrs. Rawlinson,
and another to the old lawyer himself, the
whole of Pearl's vast fortune was left unconditionally
to her young cousin, Miss Amy Mendovy.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">A Woman's Womanliness.</span></p>

<p class="indent">The Imperial Cherry garden party was fixed
that year for the 21st of April, the day proving
one of the most perfect of a perfect Japanese
spring.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl had been prevented from attending both
the spring parties that had taken place since her
arrival. Therefore, though suffering from a certain
depression of spirits which, in spite of her
efforts to the contrary, possessed her at times, she
found herself looking forward with considerable
pleasure to the coming event.</p>

<p class="indent">As a member of the Rawlinson family she had
a right to an invitation. She accompanied her
cousins, and as they drove towards the Hama-Goten
Palace, Mrs. Rawlinson's critical eyes rested admiringly
on Pearl's beautiful face, and on the almost
equal loveliness of her young niece seated
opposite to her. Her heart swelled with natural
pride as she complacently smoothed out the
creases of the purple shot silk that in various forms
and shapes had graced many an Imperial garden
party.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
&quot;There's not the slightest doubt,&quot; she ejaculated,
&quot;but that my niece and my cousin will be two of
the prettiest and best dressed women at the party
to-day. You are both of you, my dears, looking
perfectly charming. Don't you agree with me,
Tom? Come now, say something, you tiresome
person. Pay your relatives a compliment for once
in a way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Rawlinson opened his lazy eyes with somewhat
of an effort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Both Pearl and Amy are quite vain enough of
their looks without any compliments from me,&quot;
he grunted. &quot;The only thing unusual that I observe
about them to-day is that the things they
are wearing on their heads look, if anything, a
shade more absurd and grotesque than they do
even on ordinary occasions. My dear Rosina, I
do wish you would leave me alone, and make the
proper use of your parasol, instead of employing
it for the sole purpose of poking me in the ribs.
It is bad enough to be dragged to this infernal
garden-party, without being massacred before I
get there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This last remark was accompanied with a
twinkle in the very kindly eyes. Tom Rawlinson
was somewhat of a rough diamond, and he affected
a certain gruffness both in speech and manner.
His bark, however, was well known for being considerably
worse than his bite, and many there were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
who could vouch for his open-handedness in their
moments of distress and need, his ever-ready helpful
generosity, and above all, that priceless treasure
in this unfeeling world--a warm heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now don't call the garden-party names, my
dear, just because you would prefer to be wasting
this beautiful day in that stupid, stuffy office of
yours. And, Amy, don't pay any attention to what
your uncle says. Your hat is very pretty. I am
sure it ought to be, as nothing was considered
good enough for your ladyship but a fabrication
from Paris. By the bye, Pearl, do you know anything
about Sir Ralph Nicholson? Is he still
here? He never comes our way now. What's
the matter with him? I have seen him once
since his return, and he appeared considerably
changed from the genial, pleasant fellow that I
remember him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both Pearl and Amy reddened at Mrs. Rawlinson's
questions. Neither conscience was entirely
free from guilt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered the former hesitatingly, &quot;he
is still here. He came to see me yesterday, and
said that he would be at the party to-day. But
here we are,&quot; she added, as with a certain relief
she saw the entrance to the Palace gardens.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Pearl, isn't it lovely?&quot; exclaimed Amy.
&quot;I never saw the cherry trees so beautiful as they
are this year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
They walked through the picturesque grounds,
planted with the world-famed cherry tree, heavy
with its fragrant mass of blossom. Interspersed
was the graceful <i>momiji</i>, or spring maple, clothed
in its luxurious mantle of brilliant red, forming
with the dark foliage of the lofty pines, and the
varied greens of rare and ancient trees in all their
rich and perfect beauty, an enchanting contrast to
the cloudless azure sky above. Pearl for a
moment, in her admiration of these beauties of
nature, perfected by the cunning art of man,
forgot to be anxious and unhappy. Her sweet
face was no longer grave, and her eyes shone, as,
giving herself up to the enjoyment of the hour,
she experienced the charm of gazing at a landscape
glorified at that moment by glowing, brilliant
sunshine, and scented by the delicate odour of a
myriad faintly-tinted, profusely clustering blooms.</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes revelled in the unrivalled beauty of
these lovely grounds, and only when she arrived
at the waiting place beneath the ancient and wide-spreading
trees, and was quickly surrounded and
greeted by her many friends, did she realise that
she was there not merely to admire, but, in her
turn, to be equally admired.</p>

<p class="indent">She was in an animated conversation with the
Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Belgian and
Spanish <i>Chefs de Mission</i>, when Amy came up to
her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
&quot;Fancy, Pearl,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;Baron de
Pennett has just told me that Monsieur de
Güldenfeldt is still away at Sendai and Hakodate,
and all sorts of out-of-the-way places. You are
guilty of keeping him away like this,&quot; she added
in a whisper. &quot;He loves these functions as a
rule. But no doubt he has forgotten all about you
by this time. Men are strange animals. Talk
about the fickleness and changeableness of
women indeed! Just look at the pronounced
way Sir Ralph is flirting with that strong-minded
looking female in magenta. Not that I care a bit,
you know. Though I can't say I particularly
admire his taste, do you?&quot; And Amy's dark orbs
flashed disdainfully.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl let her eyes travel in the direction indicated,
and, as she looked, a puzzled expression
came into them. &quot;I seem to know that face,&quot;
she said musingly. &quot;Where can I have seen it
before?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was still pondering, when her thoughts
were interrupted by a man's voice behind her
enquiring, in a strong foreign accent, &quot;Madame
Nugent, may I be allowed to have the honour of
presenting an old friend of mine to you?&quot; and
turning, Pearl with no previous warning of the
ordeal before her, met Lord Martinworth face to
face.</p>

<p class="indent">The meeting was so unexpected,--for she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
gathered from Sir Ralph that it would still be
some weeks before the Martinworth's arrival,--that
Pearl found herself murmuring commonplaces,
and mechanically bowing, as she would have
murmured and bowed to a complete stranger.
Later on she realised how dazed, how completely
lost she had been at the moment. It was only
on perceiving the deathly pallor of the face
before her that she remembered that she was in
public, that a thousand eyes were upon her, and
with a supreme effort she partially succeeded in
recovering her presence of mind.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Martinworth had been standing conversing
with Count Carlitti, a member of
one of the Foreign Legations and a former
acquaintance whom he had unearthed in Tokyo,
when the latter caught sight of Pearl's tall figure
and straight back, clad in a perfectly cut gown.
He had already announced himself as one of her
many admirers, though, having only lately arrived
in Japan, he was unacquainted as yet with the
gossip of his new post. Always talking himself,
and never giving another a chance to put in a
word, he was so far, in ignorance of Mrs. Nugent's
history. He had heard vaguely that she was
separated from her husband, a fact which he considered
much in her favour, for in the opinion of
this vivacious gentleman every pretty woman
profited much, certainly as far as he personally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
was concerned, in being placed in a position
more or less irregular or equivocal. At any rate,
if unfortunately a husband did happen to exist,
the more such an inconvenient appendage remained
in the background, the greater approval was the
lady of the hour likely to find in Count Carlitti's
soft brown eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Those eyes were ever on the look out for a
pretty face or a rounded bust. His taste in female
beauty was considered, certainly by himself if by
no one else, indisputable. So when at the Club
he had once given out that there was no doubt
whatsoever but that Mrs. Nugent was <i>la plus belle
femme de Tokyo</i>, no one troubled, even if they disagreed,
to contradict one who counted himself
such an experienced judge of the correct and
classic lines of feminine loveliness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must, <i>mon ami</i>,&quot; he said to Martinworth,
&quot;present you to <i>une beauté--mais une beauté incomparable!</i>
Madame Nugent is English. You
see that beautiful, straight back, and leetle head
poised so haughtily? Ah, I perceive you admire!
But wait, <i>mon ami</i>, till you see her face. And
when you will have seen her face, wait a leetle
longer till you have seen her <i>en robe de bal! Quelles
epaules mon cher, ah! quelles epaules!</i> Then tell
me if we do not possess a gem in <i>ce triste Tokyo</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The introduction promptly followed, and
shortly afterwards Count Carlitti was heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
relating that <i>la parfaite beauté de cette Madame
Nugent</i> had made such an impression on <i>ce brave
Martinworth</i> that he had actually trembled, and
turned ashen from the violence of his emotions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My triumph is complete,&quot; he was saying to
Tom Spence, a junior member of the English
Legation. &quot;<i>C'etait le coup de foudre!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Coup de foudre</i>, by Jove! I should just think
it must have been,&quot; exclaimed Spence. &quot;Why,
my dear fellow, Martinworth is the very man with
whom Mrs. Nugent (that's not her real name, you
know) was mixed up with in that divorce-suit two
or three years ago. She came out here, they say,
to get rid of him. And now you go and introduce
them to each other as if they had never met before!
Ha, ha, ha! upon my word, that's the
best joke, the rummest situation I have ever
heard of!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Mon Dieu</i>,&quot; exclaimed Carlitti, with a shrug of
his shoulders, &quot;if women change their names,
how is it possible to know the right--what do you
call it--co-respondents--that belong to them?
<i>Mais sapristi! quelle guigne!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the matter, Count?&quot; asked Lady
Thomson, who, with her husband the English
Minister, at that moment joined the two young
men. &quot;You look quite upset. An unusual state
of things for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Carlitti has just been distinguishing himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
by introducing Lord Martinworth to Mrs.
Nugent,&quot; explained the amused Spence. &quot;He
evidently wished for a sensation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The British Minister was a very dignified
person, and no one realised better than His Excellency
himself that he was assisting in a prominent
position at an important Court function. At
his Secretary's words however, he screwed up his
mouth into the form of a button, and a sound very
like a whistle issued from his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Carlitti, what a terrible situation!
You mean to say you didn't know about the
divorce, and all the rest of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Mais naturellement, Monsieur le Ministre, je n'en
savais rien.</i> I desired to make a pleasure to <i>mon
ami Martinworth</i>, for he knows himself well <i>en
beauté de femme</i>. And I was assured that he would
admire <i>la belle Madame Nugent. Aprés tout j'avais
raison, je connais bien son gôut.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! you are quite right, Count,&quot; murmured
the English wife of one of the German Secretaries,
equally remarkable for her extreme prettiness, her
sharp tongue, and her very many indiscretions,
&quot;Lord Martinworth certainly knows something
about the good points of <i>le beau sexe</i>. As for
Mrs. Nugent, he has had in her case, I am told,
many years of leisure in London to study this
particular example. Well, now he can re-commence,
and can still further improve himself in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
what you dear, foolish men tell us is an absorbing
and inexhaustible occupation,--the study of the
female heart. Dear Mrs. Nugent's heart must be
so very, very interesting. It is a pity that, so far,
this boring, dull Tokyo has never provided her
with an adorer, to help to solve its mysteries.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't, I pray you, waste your pity where it is
not required, my dear little Countess,&quot; laughed
Lady Thomson. &quot;Mrs. Nugent could have had,
I feel assured, as many adorers as she desired.
But you know as well as I do, that in spite of her
somewhat difficult position she does not lay herself
out for admiration and that sort of thing. She
is certainly not a bit of a flirt. By the bye,&quot; she
added <i>sotto voce</i> to her husband, &quot;do you think I
ought to say anything to her about that horrid
man's death, and the fortune? Or shall I ignore
the whole subject? What do you think about
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By all means hold your tongue,&quot; replied the cautious
diplomatist. &quot;To refer to the fellow's death
would be in the worst possible taste. Why, I see
she doesn't even wear mourning, and quite right,
too. It would be the height of hypocrisy. Come
along, my dear. Collect the wives of my secretaries
and those other ladies whom it is your duty
to introduce to the Empress, for it will soon be
our turn to be received in audience. We must
take our place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
For the rest of that afternoon Count Carlitti
retired into the background, and this usually
volatile gentleman was extremely silent and
considerably suppressed. Allowing for a certain
amount of exaggeration, the description he gave
Tom Spence of Lord Martinworth's demeanour
at the moment of introduction was far from being
incorrect. If, instead of bounding away after
someone else, Carlitti had remained a little longer
on the spot, his surprise would have been greatly
increased by hearing the one word, &quot;Pearl,&quot;
issuing in deep, astounded tones from the man's
lips, and by witnessing the intense look of joy
that, after the first shock of amazement, illumined
the handsome but somewhat stern features. To
show emotion at an unexpected meeting, neither
words nor violent outbursts of excitement are
necessary. Lord Martinworth and Pearl Nugent
met, and had at one glance, recognised each
other. She had let her trembling hand lie in his
for a moment, while that one look, that one word,
had passed between them. She could not have
spoken if her life had depended on the opening of
her lips, and she felt it indeed a cause of thankfulness
when the Court Chamberlains chose that
moment to divide the crowd, forming it into two
lines facing each other, and when in the necessary
confusion, Martinworth was separated from her
side.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
The <i>Corps Diplomatique</i> took up their stand in
line, by order of precedence, the rest of the
crowd placing themselves beyond and behind,
where they could obtain the best view. The
military bands repeated one after the other, the
very solemn and impressive National Anthem,
while their Imperial Majesties, accompanied by
the Princes and Princesses of the Blood and all
the Court, walked slowly by between the two lines
of their respectful subjects, and that of the <i>Corps
Diplomatique</i>, acknowledging graciously the deferential
salutations of this large gathering of people.
Immediately on the passing of the Court, the <i>Corps
Diplomatique</i> took their place in the procession.
The crowds of guests followed, and Pearl found
herself leaning heavily on Nicholson's arm, walking,
in a sort of trance across the picturesque
bridges, and along the lovely verdure-shaded
paths.</p>

<p class="indent">Ralph had been an anxious and interested
spectator of the meeting between his two friends.
He was exchanging banalities with Lady Martinworth--the
recollection of whose face had proved
so great a puzzle to Pearl--when he had observed
the greeting, and his kind heart had beaten sympathetically
at what he knew must indeed be a
terrible ordeal to both.</p>

<p class="indent">He witnessed Pearl's sudden dismay, the dazed
and frightened look, and the nervous clutch of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
the handle of her parasol. Unceremoniously
deserting his companion, he made his way
towards Mrs. Nugent, and when everyone started
to follow in the procession he without a word,
simply drew her arm through his, holding her
up through all that long and silent promenade.</p>

<p class="indent">When the Imperial party at length arrived
at the marquee prepared for them, and the
crowd was waiting expectantly on the turf outside,
Ralph succeeded in obtaining a chair for his
companion. Pearl by this time had regained a
certain amount of control, and was so far composed
that she could watch with interest their
Imperial Majesties receiving the members of the
<i>Corps Diplomatique</i>, and accepting the various
presentations that are made to them on these
occasions.</p>

<p class="indent">While this ceremony was still proceeding, Amy
Mendovy occupied with her own affairs, and all
unconscious of the event that had just taken place,
came up to her cousin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You lucky woman,&quot; she said, &quot;to have got a
chair. I am simply dead with fatigue. But,
Pearl,&quot; she added, struck with her cousin's pallor
and gazing at her with anxiety, &quot;how terribly pale
you look. Are you not well, dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Nugent felt the sun a little. I have persuaded
her to sit down,&quot; replied Nicholson, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
with open parasol was still standing guard over
Pearl.</p>

<p class="indent">Amy raised her eyebrows, and instead of
glancing at him gazed somewhat superciliously
down her straight nose. She was feeling deeply
offended with Ralph. He had not approached
her the whole of that day, and--as she had confessed
to Pearl--had indeed scarcely honoured
her with his society, at home or abroad, since the
memorable piano incident.</p>

<p class="indent">Ralph Nicholson was following strictly to the
letter Pearl's advice, and was feeling extremely
pleased with himself in consequence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After all, what clever creatures women are,&quot;
he thought. &quot;Now, unless it had been put into
my dull head, I should never have dreamt of this
very easy plan of getting round the little witch.
I should simply either have cut it, or else like an
idiot have rushed off and proposed again. Either
of which proceedings would, according to Mrs.
Nugent, have proved fatal to my chances. Now
I see My Lady is just wild with me. She won't
even look at me. She saw me at work though, as
I intended she should do, on that queer fish, Lady
Martinworth, who, by the bye, is not half a bad
sort and capital company to boot. <i>Tant mieux</i>,
Miss Mendovy. Your punishment will last considerably
longer, I can tell you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus thought Ralph, as he stood at the back of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
Pearl's chair, complacently twirling his moustache,
and furtively watching the lady of his
dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">He found her looking more charming, more
seductive than ever to-day, in her pretty gown and
extremely becoming hat. Her dark eyes were
flashing, the rich colour in her cheeks was coming
and going with suppressed excitement, as
completely ignoring Nicholson's presence, she
bent down and wrapped a lace scarf around
Pearl's shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think,&quot; said Sir Ralph, this time addressing
himself to Pearl, &quot;if you will excuse me, Mrs
Nugent, as you have Miss Mendovy with you
now, and as I see many of your acquaintances
making their way towards you, I will just go and
give Lady Martinworth a look. I see her casting
signals of distress. She knows no one here in
all this crowd, you know. And she is awfully
nice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So with a grin, and a parting glance at the back
of Amy's dark head, off he went.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl watched him go. Then she looked
at Amy, who had turned, with apparently great
animation, to address one of her numerous
admirers hard by.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope,&quot; she thought, &quot;he won't over-act it.
Men can never do things by halves. And of
course, two can play at that game.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
The truth of which remark Miss Mendovy was
determined to prove. For, during the rest of the
afternoon she succeeded in attaching to her
charming person a by no means unworthy suitor,
a certain good-looking Secretary of Legation, who
long had been known to sigh hopelessly for her
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl never quite recalled how she got through
the rest of the ceremony. Afterwards she remembered
vaguely catching a somewhat distant
view of their Imperial Majesties seated at a table
within the tent, discussing their repast in solitary
grandeur. Near them were placed the Imperial
Princes and Princesses, and beyond were
little tables at which were seated the Ministers of
State, and the members of the <i>Corps Diplomatique</i>
with their wives and families. She had a dim
recollection of someone forcing her to swallow a
fragment of <i>paté de foie gras</i> and a glass of champagne,
and she once remembered raising her eyes
and finding those of Lady Martinworth fixed
with a look of mocking enquiry and scrutiny upon
her face.</p>

<p class="indent">This expression on Lady Martinworth's countenance
was an additional shock to the many that
Pearl was fated to experience that afternoon. Fortunately
shortly after this incident, the Imperial
party broke up, thereby allowing the guests the
liberty to take their departure, or the long strain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
on Pearl's nerves, and the dread that Martinworth
would again approach her, would inevitably have
culminated in a breakdown.</p>

<p class="indent">As it was, her first action on reaching the shelter
of her home was a characteristic one of her
sex. She shut herself into her drawing room,
and walking straight up to the glass over the
mantelpiece, she gazed at herself for fully two
minutes. In spite of the pallor of her cheeks
this close examination apparently did not prove
otherwise than satisfactory, for there was a slight
smile about the lips as she drew the long pins
from her hat, and laid her head back on the pillows
of the sofa.</p>

<p class="indent">She was anxious to collect her thoughts, and if
possible, to devise some plan for the immediate
future. Whether that plan would ever have been
formed it is difficult to say. As it was, her cogitations
were speedily interrupted by the simple
fact of a violent ring at the door bell.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl was on her feet in an instant, and her
hand was pressed against her heart to still its
beating.</p>

<p class="indent">Who could it be? Was it?---- Yes, it must be
Martinworth, who had probably ascertained without
difficulty her whereabouts, and had lost no
time in following her.</p>

<p class="indent">She experienced a strange sensation--a mixture
of disappointment and relief when she realized it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
was not Martinworth's voice, but a woman's, that
she heard in the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">The next moment Lady Martinworth entered
the room.</p>

<p class="indent">She made a considerable noise as she strode
with long steps toward Pearl, who was standing
erect, with a slight look of defiance in her wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you do, Mrs. Norrywood,&quot; she exclaimed,
holding out a large hand. &quot;I saw you
at the garden party, easily found out where you
lived, and thought it best to come on here without
delay, to have a necessary yarn with you. No
objection, I suppose, to my bearding you in your
den like this?&quot; she added, with a broad, decidedly
good-natured smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl drew herself up, and threw her head back
in a manner peculiar to herself. She felt completely
mistress of her actions, quite ready for the
fray, as she answered calmly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Before proceeding further in our interview,
Lady Martinworth,&quot; the name stuck in her throat,
&quot;I think it best that you should be aware that I
am known here under the name of Nugent. Will
you not sit down?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks. Oh! so you have changed your
name,&quot; was the reply. &quot;Well, perhaps it is just
as well in the circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad it meets with your approval. May
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
I offer you a cup of tea, or perhaps a cigarette?
You smoke, I believe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks, yes, I smoke. Oh! Egyptians, I see.
Fearfully doctored, you know. Couldn't think of
drinking tea. I ate enough of that spread this
afternoon to last me for a week. Pretty sight,
but I was dying to get away to have a smoke,
and now, like a good Samaritan, you have come
to my rescue.&quot; Another broad smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Then followed a silence which Pearl for one
was determined not to break.</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Martinworth threw herself back in her
chair, stuck her feet out before her, and made
rings with the cigarette smoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pretty place, this Tokyo. Been here long?&quot;
at length she ejaculated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have lived here rather more than three
years,&quot; replied Pearl quietly. &quot;Have you come
to see me for the purpose of obtaining some information
about the place or the people?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing further from my thoughts, I assure
you. You like it better than London, I suppose?
Uncommonly dull place to live in, though, I
should think. But no accounting for tastes. I
didn't know you were here, you know, or of
course I shouldn't have been such a brute as to have
come to Japan and disturbed your peace of mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl slightly lifted her eyebrows, and looked
her companion straight in the face.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
&quot;And may I enquire,&quot; she asked suavely, &quot;in
what possible way you would be likely to do
that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Martinworth tossed her cigarette into the
grate, and rising from her armchair, went and
perched herself on the music stool.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In bringing Martinworth here attached to my
apron strings, of course. Hard luck on you both,
I call it. Not very pleasant for me, either, you
know. Why, he'll detest me more than ever now,
which is saying a good deal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl seated herself in a chair near the music-stool
on which her visitor was twirling herself
round and round, accompanied by that teeth-edging
squeak with which music-stools seem
chronically to be affected. She laid her hand on
the stool to try to stop the movement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lady Martinworth,&quot; she said, &quot;do you not
think it would be wiser for us both to keep Lord
Martinworth's name out of this conversation?
He and I are old friends. We meet again after
some years, and we----&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I say,&quot; interrupted her companion rudely,
&quot;stop that. I don't want a long jobation about
your and Martinworth's friendship, you know. I
know all about <i>that</i>. Read the whole case from
the beginning to the end with the greatest interest.
I made up my mind years ago to marry Dick,
but of course everyone knew he was otherwise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
engaged, and when you got your divorce, it was
given out that he would marry you. And so he
would have done, if you had not bolted like the
little idiot you were. Well, ''tis an ill wind that
blows no one any good.' You no sooner made
yourself scarce than I seized my opportunity. I
needn't tell you <i>he</i> never asked me to marry him.
I saved him that trouble. And here I am Lady
Martinworth, whereas you are.----By the way,
by what outlandish name did you say you called
yourself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl rose and calmly went towards the door,
which she threw open.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lady Martinworth,&quot; she said, very slowly and
very icily, &quot;no doubt my education has been
sadly neglected, but I must confess, in private
matters of this kind, I have only been accustomed
to dealing with ladies. As therefore, it is absolutely
impossible for me to cope with a person of
your calibre, I must beg of you to do me the
favour of leaving my house directly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Lady Martinworth did not stir from her
seat. On the contrary, the eternal smile grew
broader on the somewhat homely features. She
took a single eyeglass from the breast pocket of
her coat, and rubbing it with a silk handkerchief,
stuck it calmly into her left eye, gazing meanwhile
complacently at Pearl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bravo, bravo!&quot; she exclaimed, clapping her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
hands, &quot;you really did that very well, you know.
What an actress you would make, with your
figure and <i>grand air</i>. No wonder Martinworth
fell in love with you. I admire his excellent
taste, 'pon my word, I do. Poor old fellow, it is
hard lines on him, that after having been your
slave for so long he should now have to fall back
on <i>me</i>. Never mind, we won't talk about him if
you don't like it. Do be a sensible woman.
Come and sit down, and leave that door to take
care of itself. I'm not going just yet, you know,
for I have something I want to say to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Much to her own astonishment, Pearl found
herself obediently following her ladyship's request.
She closed the door, and came once more and sat
down by her side.</p>

<p class="indent">If she had been asked to do so, she could not
have defined her sentiments towards this strange
woman, who all unbidden, had forced herself into
her presence. Coarse, utterly wanting in tact and
delicacy as she seemed to be, there was something
about her very honesty and good nature that
attracted Pearl. She found herself trying to
analyse her companion's character, wondering
what there was in it, and in the situation altogether,
that was tending to change her sentiments
towards her visitor. Was it sympathy she asked
herself--a feeling of sorrow that was now taking
possession of her?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
She answered gently, &quot;Forgive me for my
brusqueness. If there is anything you wish to
say to me, I shall be willing to listen to you. Can
I be of use to you in any way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Without a moment's hesitation, Lady Martinworth
rose from her seat and clasped Pearl's two
hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;you can be of great use
to me, if you will. You can be my friend. Will
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no reply, for Pearl was deeply considering
this extraordinary request. What did it
mean? Was the woman sincere, or was it merely
a clever move on her part to secure the alliance of
a person who otherwise might be an impediment,
a dangerous rival? The ups and downs of a
stormy existence had developed in Pearl a certain
mistrustfulness, a suspiciousness of disposition,
otherwise unnatural to her, and considering the
circumstances of the case, she felt in no wise
inclined to jump at this unexpected proposal.
While she was debating in her mind what reply
to make, Lady Martinworth spoke again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I see you don't like the notion,&quot; she
said, moving towards the window. &quot;Why should
you? I suppose you and I haven't an idea or
a taste in common. I have never had a woman
friend in my life, and have never wanted to have
one. Till now I have always looked on women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
as poor creatures. But somehow you seem
different from the rest. I liked the way you went
to that door and wanted to turn me out. Real
plucky I call it, and one so seldom sees pluck in
a woman. Then the way you left it when I asked
you to do so showed me you had a heart, for I
saw you were feeling sorry for me. I've got a
heart too, whatever you may think of me. Yes,
Mrs. Nugent, I've got a heart. One that is full of
love for my husband, too, though he little knows
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As Lady Martinworth uttered these last words,
she might have been called almost pretty. A
wonderfully tender light lit up the small eyes,
and the wide mouth smiled very sweetly as she
continued:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And that is just it, that is just why I ask you
to be my friend. I love my husband. He doesn't
care a rap about me, you know. No! not one
little bit. In fact, I know there are times when he
downright detests me. I well know he is just as
devoted to you as ever he was. Of course he has
adored you for years. You are a good woman, I
know you are, in spite of that nasty speech I made
about the divorce case. With your pretty face and
unhappy married life you must, of course, have
had heaps of temptations, and yet, as I look at
you, I feel convinced you have always kept as
straight as a die. You have got such nice true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
eyes. Yes, 'pon my word, I like you, Mrs.
Nugent. I feel you are a trump, and it would
make me thoroughly happy if you would do me
the kindness of calling me your friend. Cannot
you make an effort in that direction? Do try. I
know I am not a very attractive person, but one
thing I swear to you, I am neither mean nor petty,
and I am sure that, so far, I have never willingly
done a shabby action. Of course, those qualities
are not much to boast of, but they are all I
possess, so I enumerate them, and I do so want a
friend--oh! I do so want a friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At these words Lady Martinworth suddenly
hid her face in her hands and burst into a flood
of tears.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl began to think there was to be no end to
the surprises of that day. Now, behold! as a
climax to every excitement, Lady Martinworth,
succumbing, like any other member of her sex,
to an hysterical attack of nerves. It was this
womanly, weak action that conquered Pearl, and
if Lady Martinworth had but known it, she could
not have chosen better tactics to have achieved
her ends.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl understood that in spite of those mannish
ways and the abrupt speech, in spite of the general
roughness and uncouthness, in spite of all these
outward traits that on ordinary occasions would
have gone so far towards repelling a gentle nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
such as her own, that nevertheless she had there,
seated in her house in the abandonment of grief,
a friendless, miserable woman, with a woman's
heart and a woman's weakness. Realizing this,
Pearl kissed her and put her arms about her, as
only a woman knows how to kiss and soothe, and
comfort another of her sex.</p>

<p class="indent">Half an hour later, a grateful and transformed
Lady Martinworth departed from Mrs. Nugent's
house, and Pearl was left once more to her
thoughts. Poor Pearl! they could hardly be
reckoned pleasant thoughts. She perfectly well
understood that she was being entangled in a net,
that net of circumstances which is oft-times so
strangely and so strongly woven that to the
unfortunate victim entrapped within there appears
no possible loophole of escape.</p>

<p class="indent">She thought of this interview just past, and
asked herself where would it lead her? An hour
ago she considered herself the natural enemy of
the wife of the man she loved. Now, to her
bewilderment, she found she had vowed eternal
friendship and protection to this woman, who
in the usual order of things, according to all
natural laws, she ought to treat, if not with great
dislike, certainly with fear, avoidance and distrust.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet, strange to say, she did not in the least
regret her action, for she pitied with all her heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
the woman who in such a genuine outburst of
grief, had prayed for her friendship. All the
chivalry of Pearl's generous nature was aroused
when she thought of this poor, friendless, heart-broken
woman crying to her for help--to her
who, from Lady Martinworth's own confession,
was still the sole recipient of Dick Martinworth's
love. Lady Martinworth had thrown herself, as
it were, on her protection, and Pearl then and
there vowed to herself, that as far as it lay in her
power, as far as strength would be given her to
carry out her intentions, she would not prove
her false.</p>

<p class="indent">She had she knew well, a difficult task before
her, and she did not disguise from herself the
fact that in this matter there would be not only
herself, not only her own strength, her own
endurance to be reckoned with, but Martinworth,
from whom she had fled, and who was here once
more on the spot. He knew his power, and he
would surely use it. Of that she had no doubt.
Her dread of that power, of that determination of
will, was as great now as had been the case in
former years. After all,--as she had written of
herself in her farewell letter at that time,--she
was but a woman--a helpless, loving woman,
weak and frail. On that occasion, when she had
thought, rightly or wrongly, her disappearance
was for his benefit, her love had given her the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
almost superhuman strength to fly from him.
Now she had only herself to think of, and one
other forlorn woman--a stranger,--who had
prayed to her for help. Could she hope to be
given a second time the power to resist his undeniable
influence over her? Could she resist
his importunities,--his prayers? He was so
strong, so very strong, and she was so loving, so
lonely, and so weak.</p>

<p class="indent">Again the bell rang. This time it was Lord
Martinworth who entered the room, and with his
arrival, Pearl knew that her resolutions, her force
of will, would be put straightway to the test.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Tried as by Fire.</span></p>

<p class="indent">There are moments in one's career when one
knows as clearly as if written in letters of fire that
one's whole future may depend on an action or a
word. Both may appear insignificant enough in
themselves, and yet that one little action, that one
little word, may be all-sufficient to make or mar a
life.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl was fully aware of this fact as she saw
Lord Martinworth with outstretched hands, his
face and eyes all aglow, coming towards her. The
moment was portentous! Her first instinct was
to greet him with all the pent-up feelings of years,
and to throw herself into his arms; but realizing
how greatly everything depended on her self-control,
she took refuge in silence and inaction, and
shrinking back behind her chair, she waited with
down-cast eyes for him to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Martinworth did not appear to resent her
silence, or to notice the fear and unrest of her
movement. The chair acted as no barrier to his
impetuosity, and brushing it aside he seized her
two hands and kept them within his own.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
&quot;At last, Pearl,&quot; he said in a low voice, &quot;at last I
have found you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not reply, but slowly raising her eyes
to his, gazed long and steadily into his face.</p>

<p class="indent">What she saw was a man approaching middle
age, with lined face and saddened eyes, and <i>not</i>
the Martinworth whom she had known.</p>

<p class="indent">She had left behind her a man with dark hair,
frank and laughing blue eyes, and a mobile and
expressive mouth. He whom she saw before her
now had hair thickly sprinkled with grey, his
eyes, blue as in days of yore, laughed no longer,
but gleamed mournfully and somewhat wildly
from beneath the finely marked eyebrows, while
the beauty of the well shaped mouth was marred
by certain hard and scornful lines that surrounded
the slightly parted lips. His very figure seemed
altered. He was a tall man, and had formerly
been remarkable for his erect carriage. Now
there was a stoop in the shoulders, and in spite of
the well-cut frock coat, his stature seemed to Pearl
to have decreased.</p>

<p class="indent">All these outward examples of change, these
slight signs of degeneration, struck Pearl with a
sudden chill. She let her eyes rest on the man
before her, feeling as if she were in the presence
of a stranger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you not speak to me?&quot; he asked at last.
&quot;Have you no word of welcome for me, Pearl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
&quot;I do not seem to know you,&quot; answered Pearl
sadly, as she withdrew her hands from his. &quot;You
are changed, very changed. You are not the Dick
Martinworth I remember.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You find me changed? Doubtless I am.
Well! I will credit you with believing that it does
not give you much pleasure to look at a wretched,
a broken-hearted man. To gaze at your own
handiwork,&quot; he answered bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My handiwork?&quot; faltered Pearl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, your handiwork. Listen, Pearl! God
knows I did not come here with the intention of
reproaching you, but nevertheless I must tell you
a little of the harm that you have done. The
man who loved his occupations and enjoyed all
that life had to give him, now has taste for none
of these things, but on the contrary is possessed,--poor
soul,--with the demon of perpetual unrest.
The man who had a certain faith in purity
and truth, and was not otherwise than happy in
that faith, now doubts whether such things really
exist. And yet, Pearl, I did believe in goodness
and in truth, for I believed in <i>you</i>. You left me,
after years of waiting and of longing, left me at
the moment I thought my dearest hopes were to
be realised. You threw me a letter and left me,--and
in so doing you have ruined my life. Yes,
you have ruined my future and my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As Martinworth was speaking, his eyes grew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
larger and wilder, and Pearl shrank back further
behind the chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did it for the best,&quot; she murmured in a
smothered voice, &quot;Dick, I did it for your sake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took a step towards her, and clasped her by
the wrist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Pearl! You dare to stand there and to
tell me that lie. You tell me you did it for my
sake, when you know it was only of yourself, it
was only of your own reputation, your own good
name, you were thinking. I'm not a fool, Pearl,
whatever you may think me, and it was easy
enough to read through the falseness, the hypocrisy
of that letter you wrote me. Why, during
all those years we knew and loved each other,
were you not always considering, always fearful of
what the world--your little mean world--would
say? And it was just because you drew your own
conclusions as to what would be the verdict of that
world if you married me, that without one word of
warning, you left me. And you tell me now you
did it for the best, that you did it for my sake.
May God forgive you!&quot; and walking to the
chimney-piece Martinworth buried his face in his
hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl was very pale as she came and stood
before him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you believe <i>that</i>,&quot; she said--&quot;you believe
that of <i>me</i>? You are actually capable of believing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
that I, whom you loved all those years, and who,
despite your present accusations, in spite of that
overwhelming fear of the world's opinion you speak
of, you well know, braved that world many and
many a time for your sake. You are capable of
believing that I, who already had sacrificed so
much for you, could lie to you--lie to you at such
a supreme moment? If such is the case, Lord
Martinworth, I feel, that whatever may have been
the motive at the time, the mean, interested one
that you lay to my charge, or the single-hearted
one of self-sacrifice, which before God I swear it
was, whatever I repeat, may have been the motive--I
bless Heaven for the instinct that prompted
me to leave you. The man who can harbour such
a thought of the woman he professes to love, is
only worthy to be despised and scorned, as I
despise and scorn you now!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Martinworth had evidently not expected this
furious onslaught. His face expressed the utmost
astonishment, the utmost dismay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pearl--Pearl,&quot; he cried, &quot;calm yourself, I pray
you. What are you calling me? What are you
saying? If I have wronged you----&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wronged me,&quot; she interrupted, as she cast the
hand away that he had stretched towards her,
&quot;you have not only wronged me, but you have insulted
me with the injustice of such mean, such
paltry thoughts. Oh, leave me. Why have you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
come here to disturb me? I have been happy
enough these last three forgetting years. Leave
me, I implore you. You are married. Go back
to your wife, to the wife who loves you, and
leave me in peace.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Martinworth looked up with a strange light in
his eyes. &quot;My wife?&quot; he said, &quot;what has <i>she</i> got
to do in this matter? Have you seen her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, she has been here. Go back to her. Go
back and leave me. This interview is most distressing
to me. It is painful to us both. It were
surely best to end it? Perhaps later on we may
be calmer, and able to meet without mutual
reproaches, mutual regrets. Now we are both of
us angry and bitter. Oh! how could you say
those things of me? I beg you to go. I can
never, never forget what you have just said. Go,
Dick--go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tears stood in her eyes, as she held out her hand
as a token of farewell. Martinworth took it and
kept it within his own. His face had become
softer as she was speaking, and Pearl at last
realised, as he gazed fixedly at her, with the well-known
devoted look of old, that standing before
her was indeed the Dick Martinworth she had always
loved. The colour flew into her cheeks, and her
heart beat as once again she felt his touch, the contact
of his hand, and her thoughts went back to
scenes and days gone-by. He was looking at her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
with those beautiful eyes of his. They had lost
their wildness now, and were gazing down into
hers, with a world of regret, of tenderness, and of
sorrow in their depths.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down,&quot; he said, quietly, &quot;I wish to speak
to you, Pearl, before I go. You must listen to
me dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She let him press her gently back into a low
chair, and he knelt down beside her, taking her
two hands in his. He heard her heart throbbing,
and before she knew what he was premeditating,
he leant forward and kissed her lips. Pearl closed
her eyes, as for one brief moment her head rested
on his shoulder, and his lips clung to hers. Then
she pushed him from her, and rose from her chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, leave me, Dick!&quot; she cried. &quot;What are
you premeditating? What are you doing? Do
not take hold of me any more. Do not kiss me
again. Do not touch me--but leave me--leave
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had sprung to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot leave you,&quot; he said. &quot;I have loved
you so long, Pearl. I lost you, I have found you,
and do you think I can leave you now? I can
live no longer without you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no, no, no!&quot; she cried, &quot;you must not
love me now. I cannot forfeit my salvation even
for you, Dick. Leave me--and never come back.
I implore you, never come back again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
&quot;You tell me to go, Pearl, but you still care for
me. I see it in your face, your eyes. I know you
love me, as much as you have always loved me,
and tell me what is salvation compared with our
love? Our great absorbing love. Oh, come to
me, my Pearl. I have waited for you so long, so
very long, and have found you again after all these
years. Though many and many a time I have
railed against you, and even cursed you, Pearl,
I have never ceased to love you, dear, to dream of
you as mine. And now, once more we are
together, and we must never be parted again,
Pearl, my Pearl!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He ceased, but the words still rang in her ears--We
must never be parted again, Pearl, my
Pearl! The sound intoxicated her. With beating
heart, and eyes shining like stars, she went towards
him. &quot;Dick,&quot; she cried breathlessly, &quot;I
shall lose my soul for all eternity--I shall lose it
now in spite of all my many years of fighting and
of striving. But, after all, I am but a woman,
and I love you. Yes! I love you. I long for
you as much--ah! more--ah! more--than you
have ever longed for me. I am only a woman,
a poor, weak, tempted woman. What can I do
against you, who are so strong? Therefore I
come to you, my love--I come!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She flew to his arms and he folded her within
them. This time she gave him back kiss for kiss.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
&quot;Wait,&quot; she said a minute later, unclasping his
arms from her neck, &quot;wait a moment, and let me
think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, no,&quot; he cried, &quot;you must not think;
you must not wait to think. Come with me now.
Come away from this place. Come with me,
darling, where we can live forgotten and unknown.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not seem to hear him. She had walked
towards the window, and was gazing out into
the garden, where, round the shrubs and
flowers, the twilight was quickly gathering. She
stood there motionless for many minutes, it seemed
to him, then she turned and faced him. Round
the lips there was a look of great and stern resolve,
though the eyes were softened by unshed tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;I have changed my mind. I
will not--I will never go with you! My resolution
must not--cannot--be altered. Dear Dick,
I implore you to go, to leave me now, for I will
not come between your wife and you. I have
promised her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My wife!--my wife!--why drag in my wife
again?&quot; he cried. &quot;What is she to you? What
is she to me? I tell you, Pearl, she is nothing to
me, and I am less than nothing to her. She goes
her way and I go mine. She has her friends,
I have mine. She is my wife only in name. And
you compare this--this arrangement to the perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
love that you and I have for each other,--to the
devotion of years? You will let this wretched,
this unnatural state of things stand between us?
No, you shall not do so, Pearl! God knows I am
accustomed enough to your--to women's moods.
But a minute ago you said you would come with
me, you were even willing to sacrifice your salvation
for my sake. Why change now? You
shall not change now. You are bound to me by
your flight--by your word, by our love, by--by--everything,
and, by God! you <i>shall</i> come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And he caught her once more in his arms,
kissing her hands and face.</p>

<p class="indent">She wrenched herself free.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dick,&quot; she said, with eyes large with fear, and
warding him off with her hands, &quot;listen to me, I
pray you. You are wrong about your wife, totally,
entirely wrong. You may not love her, but she
loves you, deeply, truly. Indeed she does. She
wept to-day when she mentioned your name. I
promised her, recklessly perhaps, that I would be
her friend. It was a foolish, a rash promise, I
know, but while I have breath in my body I intend
to keep it. So go back to her, Dick. She loves
you. Oh, Dick, in the old days you always
listened to me. You always did what I desired.
Once more I beg, I implore you to do so now,
and to leave me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But to-day is not yesterday, and I will listen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
no longer. You have fooled me too often, Pearl.
You are free now, and you shall be mine for ever
and ever. Do you hear? For ever and ever,&quot; and
once again he was going towards her with outstretched
arms, when he stopped abruptly in his
approach.</p>

<p class="indent">The varied trials and excitements of the day
had resulted in one termination, and that a natural
one. Pearl's overstrained nerves at length gave
way. With a cry like a wounded animal she
threw herself on the sofa, her head buried in the
cushions, sobbing in all the abandonment of grief
and fear, while Lord Martinworth,--standing perfectly
still,--watched her.</p>

<p class="indent">In the many years he had known and loved
Pearl he had never seen her weep before. No,
not even that time years ago, when she had bared
her arm and shown him the bruises caused by her
husband's blow. As he watched her now in bitter
silence, he perceived perhaps for the first time,
the terrible struggle between right and wrong that
he had aroused, and a hitherto unknown feeling
of utter contempt, complete abhorrence of
self welled up within him. He knew now that
he had conquered in the fight, that he had but to
take her within his arms and she would be his,
body and soul--his for ever. But the certainty of
this knowledge brought him no triumph, no joy.
For once he saw himself as he was, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
inequality of the contest, the self-acknowledged
cowardice of his present conduct, brought a flush
of humiliation and of shame to his cheeks. He
stood for a moment hesitating as he watched the
quivering form and listened to the stifled sobs.
He took one step towards her. He gently
touched her hair. Then he paused, and with a
parting glance revealing both grief and remorse,
without a word he turned and fled.</p>

<p class="indent">And Pearl, lying there with her head buried in
the cushions, heard the door close, the retreating
footsteps, and the noise of the carriage driving
away, and then, but only then, she understood
that she had banished him for all eternity. She
rushed to the open window, and cried to him in a
voice sharp with agony; but the occupant of the
carriage was far beyond the sound of her call, and
once more she threw herself on the sofa and hid
her face in her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What have I done?&quot; she cried aloud. &quot;I
have sent him away--I have sent him away. Oh!
what made me do it? How could I do this thing?
What do I care for duty and honour? And his
wife--what is she to me? What right had she to
exact such a promise from me? Why should I
be her friend? She is my enemy, not my friend.
And her husband, my love, my only love, I have
sent away, I have sent away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus Pearl raved while the night closed in upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
her. And yet that evening as she knelt by her
bedside this prayer was uttered in all sincerity
from the depths of her heart:--</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh God,&quot; she prayed, &quot;keep him away from
me, for I am very weak and he is strong. Keep
him from me--keep him from me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For two days, morning, noon, and night, that
prayer was offered up to the throne of Heaven.
The third day and the fourth it passed her lips
haltingly but once. The fifth, sixth, and seventh
days it was uttered no more.</p>

<p class="indent">Hardly a week had gone by, when one morning,
with a racking head and trembling fingers, Pearl
sat herself down by her writing table. She did
not hesitate as she took the pen and wrote these
words:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;My heart's darling:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know now what I have done. I have
sent you away. You whom I love and
have ever loved. Come back to me. Come
to me after dinner to-night, and I will
teach you what a woman's sacrifice, a
woman's love can be.&quot;</p>

<p class="right">&quot;<span class="smcap">Pearl.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Amy to the Rescue.</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pearl, what is the matter with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This question was asked sharply by Mrs.
Rawlinson, as she scrutinised her cousin's face
with her quick eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Matter? Oh, nothing,&quot; answered Pearl,
flushing under the examination.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense, my dear! Haven't I known you
from babyhood? And for you to sit there and
tell me that you are in your usual equable state of
mind is simply ridiculous. I haven't seen you
for a week. Not since the Cherry party. You
have not condescended to come to my house, and
each time I have come to yours I have been told
that you were out, and, what is more, have had
the door calmly shut in my face by that extremely
impertinent 'boy' of yours. Amy tells me she
has met with the same fate. May I ask the reason
of this strange behaviour?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied Pearl, calmly. &quot;You
may ask what you like, but I don't fancy the reply
will enlighten you much. I was busy saying my
prayers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
Mrs. Rawlinson stared, as well she might, at
this unexpected answer to her question.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl laughed nervously at the expression on
her cousin's face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you need have no fear for the state of my
brain,&quot; she replied. &quot;I have finished now. I
prayed for the last time yesterday evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pearl,&quot; replied Mrs. Rawlinson gravely, as
she rose and began fastening her cloak. &quot;I
don't understand you in this flippant mood. I
have never known you to joke about sacred subjects
before, and I can't imagine what possesses
you now. Your looks, too, have changed. You
seem to have grown quite thin in a week. Your
eyes are shining, and your cheeks have two red
spots on them. What is the meaning of all
this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl looked impatiently at the clock, an action
which as she intended, was not lost on her
cousin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are going out?&quot; she said; &quot;well, good-bye.
We shall meet at the Prime Minister's ball
to-night, I suppose, and then dearest, you will
have plenty of time as you do not dance, to tell
me what is troubling you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl gave a sigh of relief as the door closed
behind Mrs. Rawlinson.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, these relations!&quot; she ejaculated. &quot;Much
as we may love and appreciate them on ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
occasions, how utterly wearisome and <i>de trop</i>
they prove themselves at certain moments of
one's existence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Once more she glanced at the clock, noticing
that the hands pointed to half-past five.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Three hours and a half more,&quot; she sighed, as,
for the twentieth time that day, she drew from
her pocket Martinworth's passionate reply to her
summons. &quot;How shall I ever get through
them?&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p class="indent">At a quarter to nine that evening, just as Amy
Mendovy was rising from the table, with the
intention of dressing for one of the events of the
spring--the Prime Minister's ball--a note from
Mrs. Nugent was put into her hands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Dearest Amy,&quot; it ran, &quot;As you love me
come to me immediately on receipt of this
line. I am in great trouble, and in dire
need of you. Give up the ball for my sake,
and come to me, I implore you. Yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Pearl</span>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;P.S.--I am not ill.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Amy's face clouded. What! give up the ball!
This ball on which she had so greatly reckoned
for the sole reason that she knew Sir Ralph would
be present? She had long ago decided in her
own mind that this was to be the occasion on
which might be expressed, without loss of self-respect,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
a reasonable amount of contrition and
regret. There were moments when Amy flattered
herself that she knew her power well enough to
be fairly certain that she had only to offer the
olive branch to see it promptly accepted. And
yet again, at other times, she felt considerable
doubt as to her advances being well received.
Sir Ralph's conduct of late had certainly not held
out much promise of success. She had not seen
him since the garden party, and her vanity suffered
more than one wound as the disagreeable conviction
slowly dawned upon her--that he was
persistently keeping out of her way. From all
sides she heard of his devoted attendance upon
Lady Martinworth. Though Amy had more than
once seen this lady she did not know her. In
moments of depression therefore, she found herself
picturing her rival as the owner--if not of
beauty--of much fascination and every charm,
coupled with those powerful weapons, a clever
woman's designing and seductive wiles.</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Martinworth would have been the first to
have felt intense amusement at such gifted and
extremely unlikely traits of character being
attributed to her.</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Amy was therefore, somewhat perplexed
and annoyed, and at times she felt extremely sorry
for herself. She concluded that she had already
been more than amply punished for those few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
bars played so thoughtlessly on the piano, and
sometimes she declared to herself that it was an
imperative necessity to end the present unsettled
situation. These last few weeks of uncertainty
had taught her, more than all the previous months
put together, how true and sincere was her love
for Ralph Nicholson. She could only pray now
that her own foolish conduct had not for ever put
it out of her power to prove this fact to him.</p>

<p class="indent">The ball, she knew, would settle matters one way
or the other, and it was with a feverish anxiety,
very unlike the usual indifferent <i>insouciante</i> Amy,
that she awaited the evening's event.</p>

<p class="indent">And now the receipt of this frantic little note
upset all her calculations, destroying at one blow
all her brilliant castles in the air. She hesitated.
Pearl herself wrote she was not ill. What reason
strong enough could therefore exist to cause Amy
to relinquish this entertainment, an entertainment
where so much that was momentous might occur.
Her absence from the ball would cause Sir Ralph
to doubtlessly put a wrong construction upon
her action, and as he never came to see her
now, when should she have another chance of
explaining matters to him? No, she would not
go to Pearl. It was really asking too much.
She could not give up this opportunity, even for
her cousin for whom her affection was so great.
But the moment that Amy arrived at this determination,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
and as she read the note again, she
realised that this was no childish whim on Pearl's
part, that her presence for some reason unknown
was necessary to her cousin, and such being the
case, her own wishes, her own inclinations, must
certainly be ignored.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a suspicion of tears in her eyes as,
putting the note into her pocket, she rose from the
table and looked across at her aunt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Auntie,&quot; she said, &quot;I am sorry, but I can't go
to the ball to-night. You and Uncle must go
without me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's this nonsense?&quot; growled Mr. Rawlinson.
&quot;What business have your aunt and I skipping
about at balls? We are both too old to
make fools of ourselves. Our object in going is
simply to look after you, and if you choose to take
a ridiculous whim into your head to stay at home,
why, we stay at home too, that's all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And with a look on his face that expressed:
&quot;Nothing in heaven or earth will tear me hence,&quot;
Mr. Rawlinson settled himself by the fire and
deliberately lit a cigar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm dreadfully sorry to have to give it up,&quot;
replied Amy, as she went towards the door, &quot;but
Pearl wants me. She writes very pressingly, and
though she says she is not ill, I feel I must go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How tiresome of Pearl!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Rawlinson,
&quot;and yet--though I have no doubt your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
disappointment is very great, my dear--I think
you are right to go to her. She seemed strangely
unlike herself this afternoon when I was there,
and I came away with the impression that she had
something on her mind. If that's the case, I
should have thought the best person to help her
would be myself. But I certainly have no intention
of being huffy with the poor child. Life is
too short for such sillinesses. Go and cheer
her up, Amy, and if you are not back by eleven,
I shall know that you are spending the night there,
and will give orders that the maid is to take over
your things. Good night, my dear,&quot; she continued,
embracing her niece, &quot;take the carriage
and send it back for me. Your uncle may stay at
home smoking his horrid old cigar if he likes, but
I, for one, certainly intend going to the ball. I
should never look the dear Marquis and Marchioness
in the face again if no member of the
family were to put in an appearance to-night.
There are occasions when it is absolutely necessary
to sacrifice one's self on the altar of duty. This
is one of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Amy exchanged a sly glance with Mr. Rawlinson
as she left the room. They both knew
Rosina.</p>

<p class="indent">As she entered Mrs. Nugent's drawing-room,
Amy, glancing at the clock, noticed that it marked
exactly half-past nine. Three-quarters of an hour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
had therefore elapsed since she had first received
the note summoning her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I in time?&quot; she enquired breathlessly, as
she went towards her cousin. She did not know
why she asked such a question, unless it was that
the expectant look on Pearl's face seemed to call
for it.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl was standing near the grand piano. She
looked as if she had just risen from it, and her
hand was pressed against her heart. Her tall
figure was draped in a tea-gown of white chiffon
and of silver embroidery, and her face, framed in
its masses of auburn hair, was almost as colourless
as the gown. The grey eyes were the only features
that moved in this countenance that seemed carved
in stone. They were restless and sorrowful--almost
despairing--and Amy stopped short in her
approach as their glance fell upon her.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl, perceiving the look of frightened astonishment,
turned away, and said in a low voice: &quot;I
thought--I thought when I heard the bell, that it
was--that it was--some one else. But of course
I at once remembered, Amy dear, that I had sent
for you. It is good of you, very good of you to
give up the ball--and to come to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Amy went up to her cousin and put her arms
round her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I came,&quot; she said. &quot;You wrote
that you were in need of me, and I see you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
right. What is it, darling? Whom were you expecting
when you heard the bell?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Amy,&quot; Pearl said excitedly, clasping her
tighter to her, &quot;promise me that you will stay by
me--close by me all the time--with your arms
about me, as they are now. They are so strong,
these arms of yours. I feel so safe with them
around me, and with your honest eyes looking at
me, Amy. You will stay and sleep with me to-night,
will you not? You will not leave me a
minute--until--until--until----&quot; she hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Pearl, I will not leave you,&quot; answered
Amy. &quot;Of course I will stay the night, if you
wish it. Come, let us sit on the sofa. I will
keep my arms around you, and you shall tell me
how I can help you. Come, darling, lay your
head on my shoulder--so, and tell me what is
distressing you. What do you fear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No--no--Amy, I cannot--I dare not tell you.
But you will see--you will understand shortly,
very shortly--in a minute--two minutes. You
will know, and then you will want to leave me.
But you will not--you must not, Amy. Promise
me you will not leave me. Whatever you may
see, whatever you may hear, promise me you will
stay to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Calm yourself, Pearl. I have already promised.
Have I not come to be near you? Hark! there
is the bell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
The two women rose instinctively to their feet,
with their arms around each other's waists, their
eyes fixed upon the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Amy had caught Pearl's excitement. She felt
as if her nerves were strung on wires while waiting
for the door to open. Her sense of hearing
seemed intensified, as first she heard the front
door open and close, then the slight sounds connected
with an arrival, and lastly, the Japanese
'boy's' shuffling gait, followed by the quick,
firm footsteps of a man.</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed a century to both women before the
door finally opened. At length, however, the
handle turned, and Lord Martinworth stood upon
the threshold! He took one step forward. In
his eyes was a glad light, and round his lips a
smile. But he ventured no farther into the room.
His face changed as if by magic. He seemed
rooted to the spot, his eyes resting on the
two women with their terrified faces, clasped
in each other's arms. Perfect silence reigned in
the room as the three stood motionless, staring
into each other's eyes. Amy, half supporting
Pearl, felt her form quivering in her arms, and
observing the pallor of her face feared she was
about to lose consciousness.</p>

<p class="indent">She led her cousin to the sofa, then went
towards Martinworth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me, Lord Martinworth,&quot; she said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
bowing slightly, &quot;I see my cousin is not in a fit
state to go through the form of introduction. I
am Miss Mendovy, and I know who you are, for
you were pointed out to me at the garden party.
My cousin is not well, and she--she sent for me.
I had just arrived when you came. Will--will you
not sit down?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was in a state of desperation that Amy made
this commonplace request. If she had followed
her inclinations she would have shrieked aloud--&quot;For
God's sake, go! Don't you understand
that every moment you are standing here is torture
to this woman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Lord Martinworth did not seem to hear
either the request or the words that preceded it.
He remained motionless, like one paralysed,
staring at Pearl, who, with ashen face and closed
eyes, was lying back on the sofa in a state of
semi-collapse.</p>

<p class="indent">In that moment he realised to the full all that
she had experienced before and since she had
sent him that letter of summons. For the first
time in his life he understood, through what a
deadly conflict must pass a woman who by nature
is virtuous and chaste, before she casts honour,
and purity, and self-respect to the winds. Strange
to say, he forgot himself--his own bitter humiliation
and disappointment. He forgot the rapture
he had felt on receiving her summons, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
despair and rage that had taken its place when his
eyes first alighted on the shrinking form, sheltered
in the girl's arms. He forgot all the varied,
conflicting emotions that had taken possession of
him since his entrance into Pearl's drawing room,
and, as his eyes remained fixed on the shame-stricken
woman before him, he found himself
thinking only of her.</p>

<p class="indent">Once before, in this same room, when he had
watched her weeping on that same sofa, he had
partially divined what suffering this woman,
whom he loved, and for whom at that moment
he would gladly have given his life, was undergoing.
But it was only now, seeing her before him
almost senseless with grief and shame, that the
full magnitude of the torture she was enduring
flashed upon him. He watched her there, breathing
hard, without a trace of colour in her cheeks,
and with her hands pressed against her heart,
and his whole being went out in pity to her.
And, mingled with the pity, was a feeling of
admiration--almost of veneration. He realised
to the full that the hesitation, the faltering weakness
had reached a climax, that her better self had
conquered, and though crushed for the moment,
he saw her rising triumphant from the struggle, a
nobler and a stronger woman.</p>

<p class="indent">How long he stood there, watching that shrinking
form--troubled, turbulent thoughts following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
each other in quick rapidity through his brain--Martinworth
never knew. He did not feel the
girl's antagonistic yet enquiring eyes upon him,
indeed, he was indifferent to, almost unconscious
of her presence. He knew that he was
bidding adieu, an eternal adieu, to this the only
love of his life. He felt none of the bitterness,
or unreasonable anger that had assailed him when
Pearl, with such determination, left him three
years before, for, judging now by his own sentiments,
he knew that what she had then written
was indeed the truth--that in her renunciation of
him she had sacrificed herself and her love for his
sake. But he would show her that he also could
be prompt in this spirit of self-sacrifice. He
would prove his love by leaving her, and she
would thus learn and appreciate that, erring man
though he was, he also could renounce, he also
could be strong.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes! he would bid adieu to her now. The
love, the passion of years would, he knew well,
remain with him till the grave, but--he swore to
himself--never again, by word or by action,
would he raise that look of agony and of shame
upon Pearl Nugent's face.</p>

<p class="indent">He took a step towards her, and, kneeling
beside her sofa, he lifted the hand hanging listlessly
down, and pressed it between his own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye,&quot; he said, &quot;I am leaving you, dear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
You have conquered once again, Pearl. You
have always conquered. The struggle has been
very great, harder than ever this time, but once
more you have chosen the right. You would
always do right in the end. So loving you as
much as I venerate you, Pearl, I leave you, dear.
From me you have nothing more to fear. I ask
your forgiveness for the suffering I have caused
you,&quot; and raising to his lips the hand which he
still held, he kissed it once--twice, and waiting for
no reply, looking neither to the right nor to the
left, Lord Martinworth walked towards the
door.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl Nugent half rose on her sofa. She
watched with wide-open, miserable eyes. Then
let him go without a word.</p>

<p class="indent">The hall door closed. For a long time neither
of the women spoke. Amy glanced once more at
the clock, and noticed that it wanted ten minutes
to ten. Lord Martinworth had been in the room
seven or eight minutes, and during that time
Pearl had not once opened her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">It was, nevertheless, Mrs. Nugent who, arousing
herself, broke the silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know now, Amy, why I wanted you,&quot;
she said in a low, weak voice. &quot;I thank God
that you came, for you have saved me. You
must not hate me, dear. I have been a very
foolish, a very wicked woman. Perhaps I ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
not to have sent for you, a girl, and yet--and yet--you
have saved me, Amy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Pearl,&quot; replied Amy, smiling through
her tears, &quot;don't get tragic, for goodness sake.
We surely have had enough of that kind of thing.
And it's nonsense about my having saved you,
whatever you may mean by that. Of one thing I
am certain, that my presence in your house this
evening in no wise affected Lord Martinworth's
conduct. He would have acted in precisely the
same manner if I had not been here. The man
is a gentleman. Anyone can see that. Don't
make any confidences, dear,&quot; she added, as Pearl
was about to speak. &quot;You are just in the mood
to tell me all your secrets, and, believe me, you
will only regret it later. So I will be magnanimous,
and will refrain from asking you questions.
Besides, you know, I am not a fool. I can guess
a good deal, so my magnanimity is not so very tremendous
after all. Now, dear, don't let us talk
any more, but I will sing you something while
you lie back and shut your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Amy strolled towards the piano, and, placing
her hands on the keys, watched Pearl from under
her long eyelashes. Neither her soothing presence,
nor the sweetest lullaby she could think of,
seemed however, at first to have much effect upon
her cousin's excited nerves. Pearl walked restlessly
up and down the room, trailing her white dress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
behind her, with sad eyes shining feverishly from
out the still whiter face, looking like a troubled
spirit from another world.</p>

<p class="indent">For some time she continued pacing the room.
Then, as if struck with a sudden idea, she unlocked
a drawer of her writing-table, extracted
from some hidden recess Martinworth's reply to
her letter, read it deliberately through, tore it into
a hundred pieces, and cast it into the flames. She
watched it burn until nothing but the blackened
ashes remained. At length, with a sigh of
exhaustion, she stretched herself once more on
the sofa, and ere long Amy had the satisfaction of
perceiving the eyelids droop, and the weary and
worn-out Pearl fall into a dreamless slumber.</p>

<p class="indent">Amy continued playing low strains of music for
some time longer. Then she rose noiselessly, and
seated herself near Pearl. For over an hour
Amy sat silent and motionless watching the sorrowful
and beautiful face, on the cheeks of which
traces of tears still remained.</p>

<p class="indent">And as she watched, hardly daring to breathe
for fear of rousing the sleeper, her thoughts dwelt
on many matters connected with Pearl. The full
details of the divorce had been studiously kept
from her, but Amy would not have been a modern
young lady if she had not been acquainted with a
good deal more than her elders gave her the credit
of knowing. She was perfectly aware that Pearl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
had run away from some man who had been
mixed up in her case, and who had wanted to
marry her, and though she had never heard his
name, by the simple process of putting two and
two together, it was not difficult to divine that
the man concerned was Lord Martinworth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How he adores her,&quot; thought Amy. &quot;What
a pity she did not marry him, instead of throwing
him into the clutches of that awful woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For, with the harshness of youth, it was thus
that Miss Mendovy designated Lord Martinworth's
wife. Her imagination pictured &quot;that
awful woman&quot; whirling in the giddy waltz with
Sir Ralph Nicholson, while big tears of disappointment
clouded her pretty eyes. She wondered if
her act of self-sacrifice had been wasted or the
reverse. But even as she debated this question in
her own mind, she recalled once more the look
of triumphant anticipation on Martinworth's face
as he entered the room that evening, contrasting
so painfully with Pearl's expression of shame, her
action of shrinking terror. The remembrance
of these two faces at that portentous moment
were imprinted vividly on her brain. And Amy
knew that it was needless to doubt any longer.
Her question was answered.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">On the Verge of the Unknown.</span></p>

<p class="indent">The exaltation, indecision, and agony of mind
experienced by Pearl for the last fortnight culminated
in a general breakdown.</p>

<p class="indent">Towards dawn of the next day Amy, sleeping
in the adjoining room, was roused from slumber
by sounds of talking in Pearl's apartment. The
walls of Tokyo houses are proverbially thin, even
those constructed on European principles, and as
Pearl was talking loud, every word she said could
easily be overheard. A short time sufficed to
rouse Amy from her bed, and in a minute she
was in the next room. There to her horror she
found Pearl in night attire, with wide-open staring
eyes, her glorious hair streaming down her back,
pacing frantically up and down the room,
uttering muttered sounds and incoherent words
and exclamations.</p>

<p class="indent">Amy was genuinely terrified at the appearance
of those wild eyes and flushed cheeks, at the
smothered cries and the constant stream of
senseless words. All her attempts to calm her
cousin and to lead her back to bed proving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
fruitless, she lost no time in awakening the household,
and ere long she was in telephonic communication
with both Mrs. Rawlinson and the
nearest doctor.</p>

<p class="indent">Before the arrival of these persons, Amy had
however, succeeded in persuading Pearl to return
to bed, where, with the help of the terrified <i>amahs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and by holding her down by main force, she had
so far managed to keep her. No prayers or entreaties
however, seemed to have the slightest
effect on the distracted mind, or soothing movements
to influence the restless body.</p>

Maids.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It did not take long for the doctor to make his
diagnosis. A sudden and acute attack of brain fever
was the verdict.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Nugent must have passed through some
great and unexpected shock or struggle to have
undergone such a sudden and complete collapse,&quot;
he gravely remarked. &quot;I must ask to be allowed
to call in Dr. Takayama in consultation. I find
it impossible to say how the malady may turn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And then followed days and nights, aye, weeks
of anxious watching. For long, not only Pearl's
reason but life itself was despaired of. Terrible
was the consternation caused by this news among
the many who loved and admired, and even those
who at one time may have disliked and envied the
beautiful Mrs. Nugent. Her magnificent hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
was sacrificed. Amy wept hot tears as she watched
the scissors performing their ruthless task. She
gathered the thick masses up in her arms, and
separating one glossy auburn lock from the rest,
enclosed it in an envelope. The direction bore
the name of Lord Martinworth, and on the note
paper that surrounded the tress were scribbled
these five words:--&quot;She is very ill--dying.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But that note was fated never to be forwarded
to its destination. Amy's impulses, though
generally erring on the side of generosity and
good nature, were frequently, for this very reason,
unwise. On the rare occasions, however, that she
gave herself time to consider, she seldom did a
foolish thing. A trifling incident prevented her
sending the communication and its enclosure that
day, and the next saw it safely committed to the
recesses of a drawer, from which it was only extracted
several months later, under circumstances
that brought back many a vivid and painful
memory.</p>

<p class="indent">'It is an ill wind that blows no one any good.'
Pearl's dangerous illness had at least one beneficial
and unexpected result--that of proving the
means of an ultimate meeting and a complete
reconciliation between Amy and Ralph Nicholson.
Not a day passed without the latter calling to inquire
after Pearl. Amy however, busy with her
aunt in the sick room, had never chanced to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
him, and it was only when Pearl's illness had
lasted almost a month, and the doctors had lifted the
awful weight from their minds by at last finding a
slight improvement in her condition, that an encounter
between the two at length took place.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Rawlinson had sent Amy out into the
garden for a breath of fresh air, and the girl was
seated under the shade of the great stone lantern
by the side of the miniature lake, watching the
gold fish darting in and out among the rocks, and
pondering sadly over the distress and the gnawing
anxiety of the past weeks. Great tears were
flowing down her cheeks, which were pale and
drawn. She fixed her eyes on Fujiyama, hazy and
indistinct in the afternoon sun, and she wondered
mournfully whether poor Pearl would ever gaze
at her beloved mountain again. There was one
little fleecy cloud hovering over the summit. It
was snowy white, with a silver edge, and Amy
found herself dreamily comparing this mystical,
almost transparent cloud to Pearl's pure, unsullied
soul. Her eyelids drooped. She wondered
and wept no more, for Amy slept the sleep of
utter exhaustion.</p>

<p class="indent">It was fully an hour later when she opened
her eyes to find Ralph Nicholson standing by her
side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor little thing,&quot; he said sorrowfully, as she
started up from her chair, &quot;how sad, how weary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
you look. Go to sleep again. I will leave you.
But first tell me, how is she to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Amy brushed away the tears that were still wet
on her eyelids.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The doctors see a slight improvement,&quot; she
replied. &quot;The fever is, they say, a shade lower.
But she seems no better to auntie and myself.
Oh! Sir Ralph, I am sure she will die. She cannot
resist. It has been going on so long now.
She is still delirious at times, and I know
the fever is gradually but surely wearing her
away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ralph looked at the sweet face, on which all the
joy and sparkle had died out, and on which grief
for the time being had made such havoc. And as
he looked, he knew that he had never admired,
that he had never loved Amy Mendovy as he
admired and loved her to-day in this soft and
saddened mood.</p>

<p class="indent">He sat down on the grass beside her chair and
took her hand between his own.</p>

<p class="indent">Amy did not withdraw it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Amy, dear,&quot; he said very quietly, &quot;I cannot
tell you how unhappy I am. It is awful to me to
see your grief, for, as you know--you know it well
Amy, though you never would listen to me--I
love you, and have loved you for long, darling.
May I share your trouble with you, Amy? May
I help you to bear it a little? Will you be kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
to me, and after my long waiting give me the
right to do this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Amy never quite knew how it occurred, but
shortly after this request she found her head leaning
on Ralph's shoulder, while that individual was
busily employed in kissing away the tears--tears
whether now of joy or of sorrow,--it was somewhat
difficult to tell.</p>

<p class="indent">But Amy would not have been a woman, and
certainly not Amy Mendovy, if before her lover
left her that day, she had not satisfied herself as
to the future disposal of the lady whom she chose
to consider as her rival.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Lady Martinworth?&quot; she inquired,
&quot;what are you going to do about her? You
will, I suppose, be kind enough to stop going
about with her and flirting, now that you have at
last made up your mind to be engaged to me.
Oh! Ralph, you don't care for her really, do
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ralph laughed and twirled his black moustache,
as he looked down into the flushed face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nobody,&quot; he replied, &quot;has ever yet accused
me of ingratitude. I certainly have no intention
of casting off Lady Martinworth, for she has done
me an uncommonly good turn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; inquired Amy, on the
defensive at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Simply that my flirtation, not that it deserves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
such a name--for Lady Martinworth, let me tell
you, darling, hasn't got the remotest notion as to
what flirting means--our--late--intercourse, was
nothing more nor less than a pre-arranged
plan formed with Mrs. Nugent to produce the
desired result of bringing you, Miss Mendovy, to
your senses. I couldn't have got on much longer
without you, you know. So we had to contrive
some means by which you should learn to know
your own mind. It was Mrs. Nugent's happy
notion that I should try to make you jealous,
Amy. She is ill now, so you must forgive her,
you know. And as for me, I don't care if you forgive
me or not, for now that you have once said
'yes,' you won't find it very easy to get rid of me
again. I can tell you that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, Amy wasted a good deal of breath
in pointing out that she had never for a single
instant experienced the sentiment of jealousy, a
sentiment for which, she assured him, she had
indeed the very greatest contempt. She took some
little trouble to explain that she had merely felt
considerable regret that Ralph should have--well--caused
gossip, by allowing his name to be
coupled with that of a married woman. In fact,
she begged he would understand that her anxiety
from the first had been solely for the condition of
his morals, and she seized this opportunity to
deliver quite an eloquent little homily on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
iniquity of flirtations in general, and with married
women in particular. To all of which words of
wisdom Ralph listened attentively, the effect,
however, being somewhat marred, in Amy's
opinion, by a persistent and most apparent
twinkle in the dark eyes. She inwardly wondered
if he could by any possibility be laughing
at her, and she felt that she really had some right
to be aggrieved, when, after her lecture, which
had lasted fully five minutes, he merely said in
reply that Lady Martinworth was a real good
soul, and though he perfectly understood Amy
being somewhat prejudiced against her for the
moment, he had not the slightest doubt that
eventually the two would become the closest of
friends.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is the kindest-hearted, straightest woman
I know,&quot; he added, &quot;and she really has an
awfully sad life. Martinworth doesn't care two
straws for her. He is away now--went off weeks
ago, and never offered to take her with him. She
is terribly lonely, for she knows very few people
here. I think you might take pity on her, darling,
and chum up a bit with her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Which tactless and unfortunate suggestion was
met with the severity it deserved.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Mendovy regretted, but she really did not
think that she and Lady Martinworth were likely
to prove congenial. From her childhood she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
possessed a strong dislike for mannish women.
And though, of course, she could not but feel
sorry for the poor thing's solitude, she really
feared that just at present, with her mind and
hands so full of dear Pearl, she would have but
little spare time to devote to outsiders. This fact
reminded Amy that it was impossible to waste
further precious moments in talking about a
person who really interested her so very slightly,
so that if Ralph would excuse her, she would go
and relieve her aunt in the sick room.</p>

<p class="indent">But Amy was not allowed to depart just yet. Sir
Ralph was wise enough to see that he had--to use
his own phraseology--&quot;put his foot into it,&quot; and
he mentally decided that, for the future, Lady
Martinworth's name should figure as little as
possible in his and Amy's conversations.</p>

<p class="indent">He promptly made up for lost time. And when
Amy parted from him a quarter of an hour later
the radiance of her face proved that, certainly for
the time being, the fact that such an annoying
person as Lady Martinworth existed was entirely
obliterated from her mind.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, Sir Ralph Nicholson had spoken the
truth when he announced that the lady discussed
was an unhappy woman, though perhaps he
would have been more accurate if he had contented
himself by saying that she was an intensely
bored woman. She hated Tokyo, and, for that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
reason alone, she had been somewhat disappointed
when her husband had started on his
travels without her. As for his indifference to her
companionship, she was too much accustomed to
that state of things to greatly worry herself on that
score. It was only on very rare occasions, such
as the day when she had unbosomed herself to
Pearl, that she would allow the fact of her husband's
want of affection to distress her. &quot;Harry&quot;
Martinworth was essentially practical, and if only
she had been able to indulge in some amusement
more or less congenial to her tastes to occupy
her spare time, she would certainly never have
troubled herself about what, by bitter experience,
she knew to be the inevitable.</p>

<p class="indent">But here she was, planted down in a Tokyo
hotel, with scarcely an acquaintance in the whole
of Japan save Sir Ralph and the members of the
English Legation. Art of any kind had no interest
for her, the collecting of curios held out no
inducement, and such scenery as had come under
her notice she loudly declared was absurdly
overrated. Later on, it was her ambition to climb
Fuji-yama, Nantaisan, Asama-yama or any other
mountain that might happen to come in her way,
but as yet it was far too early in the year to
think of such strenuous expeditions.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, there were two or three sights
which Lady Martinworth concluded were really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
worth her consideration--the game of polo, as it
is played in Japan, the fencing, and the wrestling
matches. Over the description of the latter she
grew quite enthusiastic. The fact that these
matches are not greatly patronised by the presence
of ladies was alone sufficient to encourage Lady
Martinworth in witnessing the performance as
often as she could get a chance. She felt no
disgust. On the contrary, she experienced intense
admiration at the sight of these gigantic naked
men, with their rolls of fat, and their huge
muscles standing out like cords, and at each fresh
feat of strength her enthusiasm increased. If all
Japanese had been built on the same Herculean
lines as the wrestlers, Lady Martinworth's admiration
for the race would have been unbounded,
but, as it was, for the natives generally her
Ladyship expressed that contempt which to say
the least is to be pitied as the outcome of ignorance,
and of an insular and unenquiring mind.</p>

<p class="indent">She told Sir Ralph she could not see what there
was in Japan to make such a fuss about. She
launched into politics, and prophesied complete
annihilation if the country ever went to war with
Russia. If the Japanese were as enlightened
and advanced as was said, why on earth hadn't
they made decent golf-links in Tokyo? What
could one think of a people who actually didn't
know the meaning of the word &quot;sport&quot; in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
everyday sense. As for their women, it was
positively laughable to think of them as never
taking any form of exercise, merely contenting
themselves by driving in 'rickshas with the hood
up, or in carriages that were closed. On very
rare occasions they did walk a few steps, she had
been told, but then, was it not a dutiful and
humble couple of yards behind the husband?
Again, what possibly could be the charm of the
Japanese woman for the European man was a
mystery altogether beyond her comprehension.
A soft, purring kitten of a creature who could
only smile, acquiesce in everything, make gentle
little phrases, and have pretty manners! Ralph
ventured to remark that it was probably these very
attributes, so unusual and so soothing, that proved
their undoubted fascination and their charm.
But at this assertion he was met with such a
stony stare of amazement that he reddened. On
the virtues and attractiveness of the Japanese
woman, and the courage and perspicacity, the
cleverness and far-seeing proclivities of the
Japanese people generally, on which subjects
Nicholson held the very strongest opinions, he, in
all future discussions with Lady Martinworth,
from henceforth held his peace.</p>

<p class="indent">As an amusement, therefore, Lady Martinworth's
bicycle proved almost her only resource.
Even there she was doomed to a certain amount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
of disappointment, for she had not reckoned on
the extreme variableness of the Japanese climate.
It developed into a rainy spring. On certain days
the roads in and around Tokyo were practically
impassable, and this inconvenience increased her
contempt for a nation whose Town Municipality
was certainly at that time, permitted so completely
to neglect its duties. A cloudless day,
perfect in the brilliancy and clearness of its atmosphere,
would however, put a temporary stop
to her grumblings, and, seizing these rare opportunities,
and commanding Sir Ralph to accompany
her, Lady Martinworth would promptly don her
bloomers, straightway sallying forth on a bicycle
ride of many miles.</p>

<p class="indent">These expeditions, on the whole, suited Ralph's
particular frame of mind, for they all took place
before his engagement to Amy Mendovy. They
would ride long distances without exchanging a
word, which gave him plenty of time for reflection
and for forming various projects and plans for
the future, which, even at this time, he ventured
to think, might possibly prove not altogether so
absolutely despairing and hopeless. While resting
themselves at some <i>chaya</i>, or tea house, or while
seated beneath the shade of a knoll of pines, or
within the shadows of a bamboo grove, in the
seclusion of which nestled many a picturesque
Buddhist or Shinto shrine, Ralph would lay himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
out to be agreeable to his companion. And, indeed,
he found her capital company, and if the conversations
did invariably turn on the subject of sport
in some form or other, he was all the better
pleased. For Ralph was a keen sportsman, and
in &quot;Harry&quot; Martinworth, whose love for all kinds
of out-door avocations was without affectation--and
whose proficiency therein was indisputable--he
found a genuine kindred spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">It was during one of these expeditions that he
happened to mention the fact of his friend Mrs.
Nugent's illness. He had not forgotten the
Cherry party, nor the antagonistic and disdainful
glances in which the ladies had indulged at the
time, and consequently he had so far purposely
avoided bringing Pearl's name into their conversations.
One day, however, when poor Pearl
was at her very worst, he proved such a dull
companion--so pre-occupied, that Lady Martinworth's
curiosity was aroused, and after some
difficulty, she succeeded in extracting the reason
of his persistent and melancholy silence.</p>

<p class="indent">To Ralph's surprise, his companion, on ascertaining
the state of affairs, promptly turned her
bicycle round, the only explanation she deigned
to offer for this spasmodic movement being her
intention of going forthwith to Mrs. Nugent's
house to see what could be done for her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I was not aware that you were acquainted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
with her,&quot; was Ralph's remark, as they raced
along homewards.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I know her. She is a dear friend
of mine. You don't suppose that I'm going to
let her die, do you, when I'm here on the spot
and able to nurse her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Considering what he knew of the circumstances,
it was perhaps not surprising that
Nicholson should raise his eyebrows, smiling
discreetly at what in this statement certainly
somewhat savoured of exaggeration.</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Martinworth did not, however, vouchsafe
any further explanation, but remained silent for
the rest of their journey home.</p>

<p class="indent">True to her word, she bade adieu to Sir Ralph
at the hotel, and cycled straight to Pearl's house,
where she had considerable difficulty in making
the &quot;boy&quot; understand, from her broken Japanese,
her desire to see the patient, but finally succeeded
in gaining admission to the drawing-room. She
sent up her card, and after a certain length of time
Mrs. Rawlinson made her appearance.</p>

<p class="indent">At the first glance the two women proved
antagonistic. Indeed, in Rosina's case it was quite
sufficient for a person to bear the detested name
of Martinworth for her to buckle on her armour,
acting at once on the defensive.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have come to see Mrs. Nugent,&quot; said Lady
Martinworth abruptly. &quot;Will you be so good as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
to take me to her? I could not succeed in making
that stupid servant understand that I wished
to see her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The 'boy' was only obeying his orders,&quot;
replied Mrs. Rawlinson brusquely, as her eyes
travelled over the extraordinary figure before her.
Lady Martinworth was still adorned in her cycling
bloomers, and with her cropped head, man's shirt,
and motor cap it was more difficult than ever to
distinguish her from a member of the sterner sex.
&quot;He was told not to allow anyone into the house.
My cousin, Mrs. Nugent, is permitted to see no
one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she sees you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely, that is a totally different matter,&quot;
replied Rosina coldly. &quot;I am her cousin. My
niece, Miss Mendovy, and I divide the nursing
between us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me help you to nurse her. You may not
know, Mrs. Rawlinson, but I am a certificated
nurse. Taking up nursing was a mere whim, but
nevertheless I was for some time nurse in the
London Hospital. Do let me undertake her
case?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rosina softened. &quot;It is very good of you to
propose such a thing, Lady Martinworth, and I
appreciate the kindness of heart that prompts you
to make the offer. But we have an excellent
trained Japanese nurse to help us, and I could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
think of taking up your time. Besides--besides----&quot;
Rosina paused, as, in spite of herself, her
eyes once more became riveted on the bloomers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, well! of course, I shouldn't dream of
nursing her in this rig-out, if that's what you
mean by staring at my knickerbockers,&quot; exclaimed
Lady Martinworth. &quot;However, surely my garments
are a mere matter of detail in such a
question of vital importance. Let me be of some
little use, Mrs. Rawlinson. Do let me assist in
nursing your cousin. She has been very kind and
good to me, and I have had so little kindness
shown to me in my lifetime that I should like to
do something to prove that I appreciate it, when
it does happen to come in my way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Martinworth's offer was however, kindly
but firmly declined. Rosina told Amy later, that
when she saw the look of disappointment that
overshadowed the plain countenance she found
herself on the point of relenting. Perhaps, being
naturally soft-hearted, she might have acceded in
the end to Lady Martinworth's desire and have
enlisted her aid. The incongruity of such a proceeding
struck her, however, with particular force
when she recalled to mind the former state of
affairs between Mrs. Nugent and the lady's
husband, and she remained firm in her refusal.</p>

<p class="indent">The proposal offered so frankly and naturally,
though declined, nevertheless won Mrs. Rawlinson's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
heart, and during the rest of the visit there
was a marked change in her manner. They
parted quite good friends. And though Lady
Martinworth was not allowed to undertake the
duties of nurse, she showed her desire to be useful
and kind in many other ways. Every morning
a large basket of flowers would arrive from the
hotel, &quot;With Lady Martinworth's kind enquiries,&quot;
and later on, during Pearl's convalescence, she
would send every delicacy within the hotel cook's
capability, and her visits to the patient became, as
time went on, more and more frequent.</p>

<p class="indent">But at the period of Lady Martinworth's invasion
there was no question of convalescence, and
for many days both Pearl's life and her reason
hung in the balance. But at length she took a
slight turn for the better, her malady yielded to
treatment, and her naturally strong constitution,
conquering in the end, one day, shortly after
Amy's engagement to Sir Ralph, she was pronounced
by the physicians to be out of danger.
It was, nevertheless, many, many weeks before
Mrs. Nugent was allowed to be moved from her
room. When at length she was lifted downstairs,
absolute quiet and freedom from excitement were
still prescribed. Indeed, the tranquillity insisted
on appeared to be the culmination of Pearl's
desires. She would lie on her sofa on the
verandah silent for hours, her eyes fixed on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
beds of purple and snow-white irises bending
their graceful heads in the gentle breeze, or on
the distant view of Fujiyama, shadowy and dim
in the hot June sun.</p>

<p class="indent">It was only after many days that Rosina ventured
to bring up Lady Martinworth's name, and
the eagerness of that lady to see her.</p>

<p class="indent">At the mention of that name, which recalled so
much that she would fain forget, Pearl half rose
on her sofa, and the cheeks, now so thin and pale,
flushed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she alone?&quot; she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Lord Martinworth is still away. He
has been away over two months now, since the
day that you were taken ill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause as Pearl threw herself back
wearily on to her cushions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot see her,&quot; she said at length, &quot;I am
too weak. She--she is so jerky--so abrupt. She--she
would fatigue me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Rawlinson did not press the point. But
she was not greatly surprised when some days
later Pearl after a long silence, quietly suggested
that if Lady Martinworth called again, she would
receive her.</p>

<p class="indent">Henceforth commenced a series of visits which
eventually proved of great pleasure and of a
certain amount of profit to both women. Lord
Martinworth's name was by tacit consent never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
mentioned, and when Pearl realised that no danger
from that quarter was to be feared, she allowed
herself to show genuine satisfaction at his wife's
presence in her house.</p>

<p class="indent">It must be confessed Lady Martinworth
deserved considerable credit for the tact and
cleverness she exhibited in amusing the invalid.
Greatly as both Rosina and Amy might wonder
at this strange and unexpected friendship, they
could not but feel grateful for each smile which
the visitor, with her quaint and caustic remarks,
would succeed in conjuring up on the pale, sad
face.</p>

<p class="indent">But Lady Martinworth was not the only person
admitted to Pearl's presence during this period of
convalescence. De Güldenfeldt had returned
from his travels at the very moment Mrs. Nugent's
condition was considered the most critical, and he
had hardly put foot in Tokyo before he was met
with the news of her almost hopeless condition.
This distressing information accomplished at one
stroke what months of absence, of distraction,
and of meditation had failed to do. Stanislas
straightway forgot the fact that for long he had
borne a bitter grudge against this woman, who
had treated both him and his proposal with such
calm and complete indifference. Not only all his
love, but all his sympathies, all his fears for her
safety, were aroused at this crushing news, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
spite of the accumulation of work awaiting him
on his return, he found he could put his mind to
nothing while Mrs. Nugent's fate hung in the
balance. He haunted the house, sitting for hours
in the drawing-room alone, or pacing the garden,
till Amy or Rosina taking pity on him, would steal
a minute from their duties to inform him how the
patient was progressing, or to give him the doctor's
latest report.</p>

<p class="indent">It was during this miserable period that Rosina
guessed his secret. Indeed, a child could have
read it, for it was easy enough to divine, and
de Güldenfeldt himself made next to no attempt to
disguise his feelings. One day, in a specially
despairing mood, he went so far as to hint to Mrs.
Rawlinson what had passed between him and
Pearl. He found a sympathetic listener, and consequently
ended by confiding all those cherished
hopes which had met with so unexpected and so
disastrous a termination.</p>

<p class="indent">Like all large-hearted women, Rosina was somewhat
of a matchmaker. At a glance she saw the
many advantages that Pearl had thrown away in
this refusal of Stanislas de Güldenfeldt's love and
protection. Promptly she decided in her own
mind that if her cousin should be spared, it would
certainly not be her--Rosina Rawlinson's--fault
if matters were not one day brought to an entirely
satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
But now was not the time to think of such
things. It was only later on, when Pearl was
passing so many hours of enforced idleness on
her sofa, that somehow it became a matter of
course that Stanislas de Güldenfeldt should be
found seated by her side, reading to her in his
pleasant voice the latest books from Europe, or
talking to her as only he could talk.</p>

<p class="indent">That Pearl found pleasure in his society was
evident. She seemed to forget that anything of a
painful nature had ever passed between them.
Her face would brighten as his form appeared on
the verandah, and she would greet him gladly
with her soft voice. De Güldenfeldt would often
wonder whether in the very smallest degree she
understood, not only how blessed for him were
those many hours spent thus by the side of her
sofa, but likewise how intensely he dreaded the
fatal moment when she would once more take up
her everyday life, and when he consequently
would necessarily be shifted to the conventional
rank of the occasional afternoon visitor.</p>

<p class="indent">But those dreaded days still seemed a long way
off. Meanwhile, Stanislas de Güldenfeldt sat
during the whole of those sweet, summer afternoons
in the presence of the woman he loved,
drinking in the poison of her returning beauty,
and dreaming dreams of untold happiness and
content.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER X.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">In the Shadow of a Tomb.</span></p>

<p class="indent">It was an early summer, and as Pearl's health
was sufficiently restored to render her fit for travel,
she was ordered by the doctors to leave Tokyo.
By the end of June the heat became intense, and
early in July she and the Rawlinson ladies
departed for Nikko, <i>en route</i> for Chuzenji.</p>

<p class="indent">On the borders of the beautiful lake of Chuzenji,
Pearl, following her cousin's example, had built
herself, during the first year of her arrival, a
small and picturesque Japanese house. She
loved this charming spot, as all must learn
to love it who have passed the summer months
by the borders of its blue, rippling water,
and beneath the shadows of its wooded
mountains. Pearl was peculiarly susceptible
to the influences of nature, and the summers
already spent by her at Chuzenji had been principally
employed in sailing her little boat on the
lake, watching with keen delight the changing
scenery, sometimes so dazzling in its sunlit verdure,
at others, beneath its sudden storms, so
sombre, terrible, and forbidding. Pearl knew the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
lake under all its aspects, and from constant
watching could foretell almost as well as a Japanese
<i>sendo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
 the rapid transformations that metamorphosed
in a few minutes the whole face of
Nature. For it is a lake not only to be loved,
but with its sudden rages, sweeping mists, and
boundless, unknown depths, equally to be feared.</p>

Boatman.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">During a happy summer on the Thames many
years before Martinworth had taught her how to
manage and to sail a boat, and the knowledge of
this art had proved one of Pearl's greatest pleasures
during those calm, peaceful months, spent
high in the Japanese hills. She would sail for
hours in her little skiff, gazing with eyes full of
mystery into the glittering blue expanse of sky
and waters, while the perpendicular sides of the
sacred mountain Nantai-san, black with the
shadows of its impenetrable forests, stood like a
giant sentinel among its lesser brethren, overshadowing,
in its gloomy, threatening darkness,
the glowing outer world.</p>

<p class="indent">But this year, before attempting the ascent to
Chuzenji, it was thought advisable, on account of
Pearl's health, to pause half way for some days at
Nikko. The nights of this lovely mountain
village were refreshingly cool and invigorating
after the suffocating airlessness of the city, whilst
during the lovely summer days Pearl and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
cousins would wander through the romantic
grounds of the Nikko temples, or seat themselves
for hours by the borders of the river, watching its
hurried rush over rocks and colossal boulders,
which year after year, to the destruction of roads
and bridges, are borne by resistless floods from the
mountains above.</p>

<p class="indent">The trio of ladies had been but a few days at
Nikko when they were joined by the Swedish
Minister and Nicholson, Tokyo being found unbearably
dull after the departure of their friends.
Nikko, with its sparkling, verdure-bordered streams
and cloudless sky, its fairylike and wooded glens,
its avenues of great pine trees dusky in the gathering
shadows of the night,--is an ideal spot for
lovers. This fact Amy and Ralph were not long
in discovering for themselves, and from the day
that the latter joined them, Mrs. Rawlinson was
permitted to see but next to nothing of her pretty
niece, and with her usual good-temper, accepted
the inevitable.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Pearl Nugent, she was at this moment
passing through a period of transition, difficult to
imagine and still more difficult to endure. She
who for so long had devoted first her existence,
and later on her thoughts to one sole object,
awoke one day to find that all was transformed--that
the dream was over, and that she loved no
longer.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
Needless to say, the awakening was a cruel one.</p>

<p class="indent">To her dismay, not only did she discover that
this passion of her life, which till now had never
even flickered, but had burned with an ever-steady
glow, not only was this passion extinguished for
ever,--but slowly and positively the fact dawned
upon Pearl that the mere mention of the name of
Martinworth was alone sufficient to give rise to a
sentiment of shrinking terror, of breathless
dismay, of overwhelming consternation and
regret. She could not think of that fatal letter of
summons, of his passionate reply to that letter,
already expressive of immediate possession, of that
conquering look of triumph on his face when he
entered her room that eventful night,--without
turning white with consuming shame, with misery
and reproach.</p>

<p class="indent">She hated herself as she recalled those moments.
And in hating herself she realised that slowly
developing was an incipient feeling of dislike
against the man who, however unwittingly, had
given rise to these sentiments of humiliation and
disgrace.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not for one moment attempt to disguise
from herself the cruel injustice of this feeling.
She knew well enough that Martinworth
had conducted himself with unselfish and most
unusual abnegation in withdrawing all claim to
one who had said, &quot;I am yours--take me!&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
She knew that nine men out of ten would have
unflinchingly held her to her word, allowing
no temporary stumbling block of shrinking
feminine vacillation to intercept the realization of
their strivings, the unfaltering desire of years.
She knew that it was his deep and absorbing love
that was the cause--the unconscious cause--of
that prompt decision of renouncing her for ever.
And yet, knowing all this, it was in her eyes sufficient
that he should have witnessed her in that
period of humiliation, that he should have
divined, if only partially, her agony of mind
during those days of weakness and of degradation,
for her to shrink, not only with fear and distaste,
but what was more--with horror and dismay
from the man she had once so passionately loved,
so ardently admired and believed in.</p>

<p class="indent">She had fallen so low--so bitterly low in her
own eyes. True, at the supreme moment of the
crisis she had fled from the consequences of her
final undoing. But Pearl's natural candour of disposition,
her innate honesty, did not permit her to
cloak over with weak sophistries and self-excuses
what she knew at one time had been not only her
firm intention, but in those days of frenzy, her
sole desire and earnest aspiration.</p>

<p class="indent">During many hours of necessary idleness she
would lie on her <i>chaise longue</i>, brooding over
every incident since Martinworth had once more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
come into her life. This process of self-examination
became almost morbid in its intensity and
repetition. But all her thought, her constant
restless brooding, did not satisfactorily explain to
her the reason of that hasty, that impetuous
appeal at the eleventh hour to Amy Mendovy.
Why had joyful anticipation so suddenly given
place to terror? and what was the impulse that
had prompted her at the last moment to indite
that desperate, that frantic note for aid?</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl believed in a God, and at times she
found herself asking if this sudden saving act,
this possible loophole of escape, had not indeed
been inspired by an unheard Voice, by Divine
and Holy intermediation?</p>

<p class="indent">This question, however, like so many that she
asked herself during these weeks, remained unanswered,
and the only feeling that stood out
clear in Pearl's confused and weary mind was the
prayerful hope that never again would it be her
misfortune to come across the man who had
given rise to such relentless feelings of shame and
self-humiliation.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Stanislas de Güldenfeldt was there,
haunting her presence like a shadow, and Pearl
did not disguise from herself that she found a
great security and peace, a certain happiness, in
the proximity of one who made it his pleasure
and his duty to anticipate her slightest wish, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
sympathise with her every thought and feeling.
Stanislas from the first moment of Pearl's convalescence
had shown himself as gentle and as
tender as a woman. With peculiar tact, without the
slightest shade of fussiness, he was always on the
spot, shielding her from every physical pain, from
every mental worry. For the first time in her
life Pearl appreciated the delight of being thoroughly
spoiled and petted. What wonder if she
learned to consider Stanislas as her own special
property, and most certainly necessary to her
comfort and well-being?</p>

<p class="indent">Amy would stand aloof, looking on with surprise
and indignation at the sight of this big man
with the strong face and commanding eyes being
ordered about, the object of every capricious
whim, every sudden fancy, and frequently
scolded like a child for his pains. It seemed
to her that there was something rather ridiculous
and certainly slightly pathetic in the
spectacle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ralph,&quot; she said one day, when for the third
time Stanislas had hurried off in the burning sun
to the hotel, to fetch an extra rug or cushion for
his lady-love, and Pearl, as a matter of course,
had allowed him to go, &quot;Ralph, will you promise
me one thing? If you ever perceive incipient
signs of an inclination on my part to treat you
like a slave, will you please jilt me without hesitation?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
I might lose you, but at any rate I should
retain my respect for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, let us hurry up and break it off at
once,&quot; laughed Nicholson. &quot;Could anyone see
a more patient beast of burden than I am at the
present moment? A sketch book, a paint box, a
camp stool, a cushion, a parasol, and soon, when
the sun gets cooler, I foresee--a coat. Perhaps
you would kindly inform me of the difference of
my fate to that of the man you pity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't talk nonsense, Ralph. You know perfectly
well what I mean. Pray, do I keep you
constantly on the trot? Why, the poor man is
never allowed a second's leisure or repose. He's
a slave, a perfectly abject slave. Pearl looks upon
his devotion, upon the sacrifice of his time, not
only as a matter of course, but as her right. And
they're not even engaged yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, one thing is they are bound to be before
long,&quot; replied Ralph. &quot;Bless you, my dear girl,
he likes it, he glories in it. That rather stern
'phiz' of his has borne of late quite a seraphic
expression. Leave the poor fellow alone, Amy,
and let him be happy in his own way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All I can say is,&quot; replied Amy severely, &quot;it is
quite the last way I should have expected Stanislas
de Güldenfeldt, of all people, to choose to be happy.
It makes me quite ill to see a splendid big fellow
like that reduced to the rank of the tamest of tame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
cats, and what is more, appearing to delight in
that extremely humiliating position.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't distress yourself, my child,&quot; laughed
Ralph, as they wandered off to their favourite seat
beside the river. &quot;It is a ridiculous phase through
which we men pass, one and all, each as our turn
comes. And though you pretend not to see it,
Amy, I at this present time am in a precisely
similar idiotic stage. Bless you, I know it, and do
I complain? On the contrary, I survive the
ordeal extremely well, while to the general outsider
I appear, I am sure, as beaming and as blissfully
foolish as de Güldenfeldt. We both have
every intention of getting our <i>quid pro quo</i> later
on, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The person discussed was, as Nicholson announced,
entirely satisfied with the existing state
of affairs. Monsieur de Güldenfeldt would indeed
have been willing to allow matters to proceed in
the same easy fashion for ever, had he not one
day received a warning that it was time for him to
speak again.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Rawlinson had been watching the progress
of events with characteristic shrewdness.
Her observations caused her after a time to
conclude that de Güldenfeldt and Pearl had
both reached a stage which, however delightful
in its dreamy uncertainty, certainly as far as
the future of her cousin was concerned, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
a long way from being either practical or desirable.</p>

<p class="indent">She therefore made up her mind that matters
should be brought to a climax. A prompt and
decisive action appeared still more necessary on
the receipt one morning of a letter from Lady
Martinworth, announcing the fact of the couple's
premeditated visit to Chuzenji, and begging Mrs.
Rawlinson to telephone for rooms at the hotel.</p>

<p class="indent">Rosina's heart sank at this news, for though
Pearl had never taken her cousin into her confidence,
her ravings during her delirium, independently
of her subsequent melancholy, were
facts sufficient to explain the unfortunate influence
Lord Martinworth still exercised over the younger
woman's impressible and sensitive nature.</p>

<p class="indent">She saw how absolutely necessary it was before
his appearance once more upon the scene that
matters between Pearl and de Güldenfeldt should
be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. Rosina
was never long in making up her mind, and
having once determined on a little judicious
meddling, she captured the would-be lover one
day as he was lounging off to join Pearl, and in a
manner thoroughly typical, straightway went to
the point.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur de Güldenfeldt,&quot; she said, as she
took his arm and led him over the stony road
through the straggling Japanese village, &quot;I want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
to speak to you about Pearl. You remember
your conversation with me some weeks ago, do
you not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied the Swedish Minister,
whose cheeks flushed like a boy's at this abrupt
mention of Mrs. Nugent's name, &quot;certainly, I
remember it, and your kindness to me during her
illness. What is it you want to say, Mrs. Rawlinson?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course,&quot; resumed Rosina, &quot;I should not
venture to broach the subject if you had not yourself
first mentioned your hopes to me. Monsieur
de Güldenfeldt----&quot; and Rosina stopped in her
walk and gazed at him straight with her shrewd
brown eyes, &quot;I think, if you wish to make certain
of Pearl, you ought to ask her again without further
delay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">De Güldenfeldt kicked a stone in the pathway.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why,&quot; he said, &quot;why this hurry?&quot; He laughed
uneasily. &quot;To tell you the truth,&quot; he added, &quot;I
acknowledge to you--I am afraid! That's a nice
confession to make, is it not? for a man of my age
and experience, and one who is half an Englishman
to boot? I'm afraid--downright afraid to
again ask Mrs. Nugent to be my wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He paused, and then continued nervously: &quot;It
would be more than I could bear if she refused
me a second time, you know. Why not leave well
alone? Matters are pleasant enough as they are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
&quot;Very well, of course you know your own
business best,&quot; replied Rosina calmly. &quot;I certainly
don't venture to prophesy the result of your
proposal. I mistrust my own sex too well to
answer for their vagaries. Nevertheless, my dear
friend, I think Pearl is beginning to learn your
value, and--and--by the bye,&quot; she added, glancing
quickly up into his face, &quot;the Martinworths
are going to Chuzenji. We are to engage rooms
for them, as they wish to escape the heat of Tokyo
as soon as possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Monsieur de Güldenfeldt made no reply. But
with considerable satisfaction Rosina observed,
through the corners of her eyes, the change in
his expression at her communication.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If that won't bring him to his senses, nothing
will,&quot; she thought.</p>

<p class="indent">And as usual, Rosina was right.</p>

<p class="indent">All during this happy time of inaction de
Güldenfeldt had not once thought of Martinworth's
existence. Lord and Lady Martinworth had
arrived in Japan during his absence from the
capital. On his return he had more than once
met the latter at Pearl's house. He had inquired
after the husband, been told he was travelling, and
since then had never given him another thought.</p>

<p class="indent">Naturally, he knew nothing of what had occurred
in Tokyo. Mrs. Rawlinson's tone and expression
of countenance had however, been more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
significant. Stanislas awoke suddenly to the fact
that, with the re-arrival on the scene of operations
of the man who had formerly played so important
a part in Pearl's life, there arose an obstacle, a
threatening danger, on which he had but little
reckoned, and for which he found himself totally
unprepared.</p>

<p class="indent">In spite, therefore, of the timidity of which he
had made so <i>naïve</i> a confession, he resolved to
take Mrs. Rawlinson's friendly hint, and to speak
again without delay.</p>

<p class="indent">The opportunity was not long in occurring.</p>

<p class="indent">That afternoon Pearl announced her intention
of attempting the ascent to Ieyasu's Tomb.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
 So
far, she had not ventured to climb the numberless
steps that lead to the Shogun's last resting place,
but it was a spot she dearly loved, and she never
left Nikko without paying this hallowed ground at
least one visit.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_12_12">
<span class="label">[12]</span></a>
Ieyasu was the first Shogun of the Tokugawa dynasty.
His remains were removed to their present resting place
at Nikko in 1617.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It was somewhat late in the afternoon when
she and de Güldenfeldt left the hotel. As they
walked through the Temple grounds and arrived
at the steps the sun was still hot, and glistened
like a stream of fire through the forests and belts
of brilliant maple trees beyond, lighting up their
sheeny green with a glory of colour, golden, dazzling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
and intense. Both were silent as they slowly
mounted the steps, bordered by the moss-grown
balustrade of stone. Beyond was the glowing
outer world, but here around them, centuries
old, were the black and threatening cryptomeria
pines, towering on either side like great angels of
darkness spreading wide their gloomy wings,
while away in the distance through the vast
dreamy forest, the wind rose and fell with mystical
and harmonious cadence.</p>

<p class="indent">Up and up they climbed, and as she paused for
breath Pearl felt a delightful feeling of exaltation
at the sight of these lofty trees, these grand and
ancient pines, guarding like giant sentinels the
balustrade of stone, and the wide and numberless
steps, green with moss and age. She knew so
well that this solemn approach led,--not to some
magnificent palace, not to some temple, gorgeous
with colouring, and wonderful with intricate
carvings, but--buried within the heart of the
forest--to a little lonely tomb of bronze, shaped
like an urn, and guarded on either side by
the sacred stork, the symbolic and gigantic lotus
leaves.</p>

<p class="indent">What more noble--what more awe-inspiring
than this towering, upward, and impressive approach
to all that is most pathetically simple,
most modestly unadorned of funeral monuments
to the honoured and beloved dead? Only an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
artist mind of an artist country could have
planned, created, and carried out this beautiful
and poetical thought, and only artist
minds, such as Pearl's and de Güldenfeldt's,
could know how to appreciate,--how to
adore,--the nobility and grandeur of the conception.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl was still silent as she sat down on the
stone coping surrounding the bronze urn, listening
to the wind as it musically and eternally
sighed through the banks of trees beyond. Just
before starting for her walk Rosina had told her
of Lady Martinworth's letter, and she was still
under the influence of dismay aroused by the
unwelcome news. A feeling not only of complete
helplessness, but of approaching evil, overshadowed
her. She felt stupefied, paralysed by
what she had heard. The news was totally unexpected,
for only the day before Pearl left Tokyo
Lady Martinworth had volunteered the information
of her approaching departure from Japan.
Pearl found herself wondering what unforeseen
circumstances could have caused her to change
this determination. Was it that Lady Martinworth
had made her arrangements without consulting
her husband? and was it possible that he
himself had other plans in view? In spite of his
assurances and promises in her house that night,
was it--could it be--that he wished to see her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
again, that he still had hopes, was still unwearied
in his pursuit?</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl's growing dislike awakened her suspicions,
and made her foresee and fear every probable,
every improbable design on Martinworth's part,
all sense of justice being swamped in this newborn
dread of a man she had been willing not so
long since to follow to the end of the world.</p>

<p class="indent">She was aroused from these anxious forebodings,
these problematical and gloomy prognostications,
by the sound of her companion's
voice. He had seated himself by her side on the
coping, and on glancing up into his face, Pearl
was struck by its gravity and unusual pallor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Nugent,&quot; he said slowly, looking at her
very intently, &quot;will you be so kind as to give me
your attention for a few moments? I wish to ask
you something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl, who understood instinctively the meaning
of these preliminary words, flushed--merely
bowing her assent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some months ago,&quot; continued de Güldenfeldt
gravely, &quot;I ventured to ask you for your hand.
You refused me. And I confess I took your
refusal very much, very deeply to heart. I felt
then that, however much I might desire you for
my wife, I could never bring myself to repeat the
request. But I love you dearly, Pearl,&quot;--here his
eyes grew large and soft as they rested on her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
face--&quot;you are everything in the wide world to
me. I feel I cannot live without you, and before
this one absorbing passion of my life, all my surprise,
my anger, my pride have fallen away from
me, and now once more I beg you to listen to
me, and to grant me the great gift of your most
precious self.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As he said the last words, Stanislas rose from
his seat, and standing before Pearl, held out his
two hands towards her.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl said nothing in reply, but with a smile of
great sweetness simply placed her hands in his.
He drew her up beside himself, and bending
down, kissed her on the forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">And thus they silently stood lit up by the slanting
sun, while the wind sang in the trees its
eternal song of peace. Stanislas held her in his
arms, a great joy filling his heart as he gazed down
into the beautiful pale face of this woman whom
he had gained at last, and whom he vowed to
himself should one day love him as he loved her.</p>

<p class="indent">At length Pearl broke the long and expressive
silence, until now only disturbed by the throbbing
of their hearts.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur de Güldenfeldt,&quot; she said quietly, as
she drew herself slightly away from him, &quot;you
have asked me to be your wife, and I accept, for
I know now that though I cannot yet give
you my love, I like you much, yes, very, very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
much. Perhaps, however, when you hear what I
have to say, you will regret what you have done.
Better however, a thousand times that you should
know now, and part from me while your love is
still young, than that in the years to come you
should discover my weakness, learn in consequence
to despise me, and leave me to die of grief. Will
you listen a moment to me, Stanislas, while I tell
you what happened after you left Tokyo?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">De Güldenfeldt's face clouded, but he answered
gently as he once more put his arms around her
and drew her to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Pearl,&quot; he said, &quot;I will not listen to you.
It is better not, dear. I wish to know nothing. I
believe in you and trust you, darling. Have I not
known your life for years? Has it not been as
an open book to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and for that very reason,&quot; replied Pearl
firmly, &quot;there must be no closed chapters in it.
If you do not let me speak now, I cannot be your
wife. For I have sworn,--my friend,--there must
be no secrets between you and me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speak, then,&quot; replied de Güldenfeldt, somewhat
sadly, &quot;if you will it so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Pearl did not seem in a hurry to take advantage
of the permission thus reluctantly given.
With a sigh she sat down again on the stone
coping, half shielding her face with her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">At length she opened her lips to speak. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
voice was low, but there was a clearness, an incisiveness
in the tones that impressed her listener.
She gazed straight before her and spoke unhesitatingly,
as if relating an oft-repeated tale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shortly after you left,&quot; she said, &quot;the Martinworths
arrived in Tokyo.  I had been warned
of their approaching arrival. Nevertheless, I
eventually met them unexpectedly at the Imperial
garden-party. It was a shock to me to see them--to
see him--there, and on my return home I
was still thinking over this meeting, when Lady
Martinworth called on me. Before her departure
from my house she confided to me her attachment
to her husband, and she told me that she
was a very unhappy woman. She made also a
strange request. She asked me to be her friend.
She appeared very much moved, very much upset.
Finally I took her in my arms and comforted her,
and, feeling very, very sorry for her, I promised her
my friendship.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here Pearl paused, and looked up at Monsieur
de Güldenfeldt with a slight flush on her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She had hardly left me,&quot; she continued, &quot;when
Lord Martinworth was announced. I perceived
at once the change--a change for the worse--in
him. But I was hardly prepared for his accusations
against me, as the cause of that change.
He blamed me for many things, and seemed to
think my leaving him after obtaining my divorce--when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
I might have been his wife--was prompted
by interested motives. My anger rose at the injustice
of his accusations, and I replied very
strongly, very bitterly, begging him to leave me
and to return to his wife. I held out my hand to
him as a token of farewell, and as he took it
between his own and kept it there, I felt the
revival of all my love for him. He pleaded with
me&quot;--here Pearl grew pale once more--&quot;and I--and
I--listened, Stanislas--at last--to his pleading.
I was on the point of yielding to his prayers, for I
felt I had loved him so deeply, and for so very
long--I was yielding, I say--when I remembered
my recent promise to his wife. It was that
remembrance, I think, that made me pause. I
bade him go. And he left me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this juncture Pearl remained silent a long
time. So long, indeed, that de Güldenfeldt
thought she had completed what she wished to
say, and he was himself about to speak when--holding
up her hand to silence him--she continued:--</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, Stanislas, comes the worst part of
what I have to say. It is death to me to tell you
what followed, but even at the risk of losing you
for ever I feel you must, before calling me your
wife, know the truth about me. Martinworth was
hardly out of the house before I repented of
what I had done. I longed for him so. And I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
was so very, very lonely. That night, however,
and for many days and nights, I prayed God to
keep him from me. I prayed with all my heart,
with all my strength, and yet were my prayers
truly sincere? I know not. I thought they
were. But one day, when I saw that he kept
away, that he did not come, I wrote to him and
told him--and told him--that--&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here Pearl paused again, hiding her face in
her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said de Güldenfeldt gravely, as he laid
his hand gently on her arm, &quot;I understand, dear.
Don't enter into particulars. Don't pain yourself
by unnecessary explanations.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expected him that evening,&quot; continued Mrs.
Nugent in a muffled voice, &quot;and Stanislas--I was
happy, quite happy in the thought that he would
come to me. But even now, I cannot tell how
or why it was, but as the hour drew near I began
to feel--to realise the enormity of my sin. It came
upon me with a sudden flash that I--I who had
fought and resisted and striven so long, that I,
Pearl Nugent--so proud of my virtue, so scornful
of the want of it in others--was falling from the
height of my pride and self-content, falling,
falling--to utter destruction, to utter perdition of
body and of soul.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The horror of that moment--of that awakening--I
can never express. The iron has entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
into my soul, and will leave its mark for ever. At
first, I believed it was too late to retract. I did
not know what to do--where to fly from the
misery and dishonour that I knew were overtaking
me. Then I thought of Amy. And though she had
told me she was going to a ball that night, a ball
that would settle her future one way or the other,
I wrote begging her to give it up, imploring her to
come to me at once. She came. And her
presence in my house that evening saved me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Martinworth?&quot; inquired de Güldenfeldt,
fixing his piercing eyes on Pearl's face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord Martinworth came at the hour appointed.
He stayed a short time, a very short time. I can
hardly tell you what passed--for I know that I--I--was
partially unconscious most of the time that
he remained. I remember however, his leave-taking.
It was, Stanislas, an eternal farewell. He
acted generously--nobly, as only he could act.
But I hardly knew what he said. I longed so for
him to leave me--for him to go. And it was only
when the door closed behind him that I breathed
and lived once more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, my friend, you have heard all I have
to tell you. It is, I know, a shameful story. A
story of weakness and of humiliation. Since that
awful night, my one hope, my one prayer, has been
never more to set eyes on this man, who until that
evening had for so many years engrossed my affections
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
and my thoughts. My prayer, it appears, is
not to be answered. He is going to Chuzenji.
The knowledge of this move of his I thought at
first would kill me. But now I know that you
love me, that you are near me and--and----&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! you know all, and, Stanislas, perhaps
now you will retract your words, and cast me off--and
say you do not care for me. For indeed,
I am not worthy--unstable, foolish, weak woman
that I am--to be the wife of such a man as you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl ceased. And for a moment there was
silence. Mrs. Nugent felt herself trembling, as
with averted eyes she gazed out at the waving pine
trees far before her. De Güldenfeldt's face, which
had been grave and rather stern while Pearl was
speaking, remained pensive for some seconds
longer. He looked at her and his expression
changed, while a gleam like a ray of sun lit up his
blue eyes. He smiled very sweetly as he took
Pearl in his arms, and pushing back the little
auburn curls, kissed her again on the forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My poor child--my poor child,&quot; he murmured,
&quot;to think that once you should have told me that
bitter experience had taught you a lesson--the
lesson how to protect yourself. Ah, Pearl, you
may be beautiful--you may be sweet--you may
be the angel of goodness that I think you, in spite
of the many hard names you call yourself,--you
may be all these things and much, much more,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
but of one fact I am certain--you are sadly in
need of someone to help you, to take charge of
you, to guide you, darling. That task, with your
permission, I, Stanislas de Güldenfeldt, mean for
the future to undertake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, in perfect peace and contentment, they
sat together until the evening fell and the stars
came out. It was only as they slowly wended
homewards that Pearl, on looking back into the
gloaming, realised with dread and a sad foreboding,
that their mutual vows had been interchanged
beneath the shadow of a tomb.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">The Price of a Kiss.</span></p>

<p class="indent">Pearl's engagement to Stanislas de Güldenfeldt
was not generally announced. They both had
their reasons for keeping the fact to themselves,
and it was only Mrs. Nugent's immediate family,
and Sir Ralph Nicholson, as so soon to form
one of that family, who were initiated into the
secret.</p>

<p class="indent">Rosina was radiant, as indeed she well might be,
for, after months of feminine vacillation, were not
both her beautiful charges at last satisfactorily
disposed of? Naturally, perhaps, she took the
credit of Pearl's engagement entirely to herself.
She told her husband it would never have come
off if it had not been for that necessary progging,
given so judiciously to the devoted and constant,
yet hesitating lover.</p>

<p class="indent">At this information Mr. Rawlinson growled
forth the remark that she would far better have
left matters alone. That people who mixed themselves
up in such affairs generally ended by burning
their own fingers, and that if de Güldenfeldt,
at his age, didn't know his own mind, well, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
that he could say was he was a far greater fool
than he had given him credit for being.</p>

<p class="indent">He further remarked--for when once wound
up Tom Rawlinson was not devoid of conversation,--that
it was perfect bosh, in his opinion,
this ridiculous effusion and fuss over a simple and
every-day engagement of marriage. No doubt
all the world gushed in the same absurd manner
over Pearl's first marriage. And pray, how had
that turned out? Certainly he, for one, didn't
see that de Güldenfeldt was doing such a
very good thing for himself. True, Pearl was a
pretty woman, pleasant too, and had an uncommonly
good fortune of her own. But then, look
at that business with her first husband, to say
nothing of that uncomfortable scandal with that
fellow Martinworth, who, in his opinion, would
far better have kept in England, instead of coming
to Japan and getting into further mischief.</p>

<p class="indent">For his own part, he liked de Güldenfeldt. He
was a capital chap, and he thought it was a pity
he was wasting himself on a woman who, in spite
of certain attractions, never succeeded in being of
the same mind two days running. In fact, in his
humble opinion, he was far too good for Pearl.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, having reduced his wife almost to the
verge of tears, Tom Rawlinson took his hat and
went for a tramp across the hills.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, shortly after he had relieved his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
mind in this downright fashion, Mr. Rawlinson
informed Pearl that it was his express wish that
she should be married from his house. He likewise
announced his intention of bearing all the
expenses of the <i>trousseau</i> and the wedding. In
fact he begged that she would understand that
she was to look upon herself, for that occasion at
least, as a daughter of the house. Further, he
requested her acceptance of a trifling cheque
with which to buy herself a jewel, which, he need
not add, he would feel greatly flattered by her
wearing on her wedding day.</p>

<p class="indent">The cheque was a substantial one, representing
the sum of a hundred guineas.</p>

<p class="indent">By this time all the party had moved up to
Chuzenji. Pearl was supremely happy in her
Japanese wooden house on the borders of the
lake. She loved her picturesque, bright little
abode, with its fresh, clean <i>tatami</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
 its beautifully
engrained wood, its white walls and ceilings, and
its sliding paper doors and cupboards. But above
all, she loved the broad, cool verandah, on which
was passed the hot period of the day, and from
which was visible the most extensive, the most
lovely view of lake and mountains in all Chuzenji.
She would rest her arms on the balustrade of this
verandah, which hung completely over the water,
and there she would remain, idle and happy for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
hours, watching the limpid, laughing lake with
its frame of wooded mountains and its ever
changing banks of clouds.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<a href="#FNanchor_13_13">
<span class="label">[13]</span></a>
Japanese matting.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">But it was in the early morning that Pearl
found Chuzenji the most seductive, that she loved
it best. After the opening of the <i>amado</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
--without
which protection against storm and rain
and thieves no Japanese house would be complete--she
would lie in bed, and with her face turned
towards the lake would watch with a dreamy fascination
the scene before her.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_14_14">
<span class="label">[14]</span></a>
Outside wooden shutters.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">And indeed, the picture upon which she gazed
with enchanted eyes was an ideal one. The sapphire
blueness of the water, on which at that
hour seldom a ripple was to be seen--the chain
of wooded mountains rising up large and indistinct,
and garlanded by vast pearly belts of caressing,
fleecy clouds,--the little village on the opposite
side, with its sparkling beach and tiny wooden
houses, glistening like snow in the brilliant
sun--the Japanese fishing boat, with one great,
white wing faintly fluttering in the soft and
wavering breeze--Pearl would gaze entranced at
all this bewitching beauty of the mysterious
silent morn, enveloped in a hazy mantle of perfect
peace and calm--and, gazing, she would
thank God that she lived.</p>

<p class="indent">Monsieur de Güldenfeldt was as enthusiastic as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
his <i>fiancée</i> over the varied charms of Chuzenji.
They would pass together the greater part of those
sweet, sunny days, either sailing or rowing on the
lake, or when they wished to vary their form of
exercise, taking long tramps across the mountains
to the plains where the myriads of wild flowers
and the great white tiger lilies grow. As Pearl
became stronger, they would sometimes walk to
the neighbouring village of Yumoto, most beautiful
and secluded, with its forest of giant pines
and maples that overhang the miniature lake.
Curious and unique, too, is this lovely mountain
spot, its chief characteristic being its open-air
sulphur baths, among the suffocating fumes of
which the lower-class Japanese of both sexes are
seen disporting themselves, sometimes for hours at
a time, their sole array being Nature's garb of
innocent simplicity.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, Pearl was far from feeling that
happiness and contentment of mind she certainly
counted upon when she bound herself by promise
to marry Monsieur de Güldenfeldt. As the days
passed she knew, without analysing her feelings
very deeply, that it was impossible for her to give
that love that he in time would without doubt
claim as his due. In spite of his many delightful
qualities which called forth her sincere admiration,
in spite of his more than ordinary share of
intelligence and good looks, of the seductive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
tones and subtle charm of manner, and above all,--in
spite of his great and absorbing devotion to
herself, Pearl Nugent's heart did not beat one
iota the faster at the sound of his voice, at the
touch of his hand, or at his presence by her side.</p>

<p class="indent">And the day when she discovered to her dismay
the fact that not only did she not care for him,
but that, above all, de Güldenfeldt's great affection
for herself was acting as an irritant upon her
nerves, Mrs. Nugent was indeed a woman to
be pitied. Before her engagement she had
thoroughly appreciated the hundred little attentions
with which he had surrounded her, and
what is more, had almost looked upon them as
her right. Now however, that she was bound to
him by promise, she found her feelings undergoing
an unexpected and most lamentable transformation.
She made every effort to disguise
this change of front from her lover, and she flattered
herself that she succeeded fairly well.</p>

<p class="indent">Her surprise, therefore, would have been profound,
and would have equalled her dismay, if
she had divined that Stanislas de Güldenfeldt was,
to a very great extent, aware of the constant and
bitter struggle that was being fought within her
heart.</p>

<p class="indent">De Güldenfeldt was, however, a patient man.
His chief object had been gained, namely,
Pearl's promise of herself. He was, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
content to bide his time for what he flattered himself
must necessarily follow ere long--the promise
of her love.</p>

<p class="indent">But though generally right in his calculations,
on this occasion the Swedish Minister was entirely
at fault. Indeed, it was not surprising that in this
instance he should make a mistake. De Güldenfeldt's
knowledge of the intricate workings of the
female mind was unusually vague and superficial
for one who so prominently and for so many
years had mixed in the world. His immersion
hitherto in the political and the more serious side
of his profession, and the life led--as a recreation
to those duties--of scientific thought and study,
was the worst school for attaining a knowledge of
womankind. Stanislas at this period of his
existence, though he was the last to acknowledge
this deficiency, was more ignorant than many a
modern youth of twenty of those inexplicable
feminine contradictions that contribute not only
towards the frenzy and the despair, but likewise to
the frequent destruction of too confiding man.</p>

<p class="indent">If his experience of women had been a trifle
greater, de Güldenfeldt's eyes would have opened
to the fact that this very indifference to his
presence, this very shrinking from his words and
acts of affection, which Pearl tried so vainly to
disguise, was the sure and certain proof that no
amount of persuasion, of patience, or of tact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
would succeed in securing him that love on which
he relied for his future happiness. If he could
but have known it, Pearl was simply incapable of
again feeling a throb of passion. Her devotion
for Martinworth had lasted too long--had burnt
too deeply into her soul--to be capable of being
rekindled, or of blazing afresh, lighted by another
hand. Pearl knew it now. And as the days
went on, and she was more and more in de
Güldenfeldt's society, and as more and more he
treated her as his own especial property, she
gradually realized that of the many mistakes she
had made of late, this last was the most disastrous,
the most fatal of her life.</p>

<p class="indent">It was about this time that Mrs. Nugent
received an answer to her letter to Mr. Hall.
Enclosed with the letter was a copy of her will
drawn up from the rough draft she had sent her
lawyer, and which only required to be signed and
witnessed to make it legal. Pearl put the private
letter aside to be perused at leisure, and witnessed
by Count Carlitti and Tom Rawlinson, she signed
the document, with the intention of despatching
it by the mail that was leaving the same day.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Rawlinson was nothing if not business-like.
And whereas Carlitti had signed the will
in a blissful state of ignorance as to its purport
or contents, and at the sight of a favourite
lady-friend sweeping past Pearl's door had immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
hurried in pursuit,--the former, before
venturing to put his name to paper, had ponderously
read and weighed every clause of the document.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will excuse me, Pearl,&quot; he said, as after a
very firm and upright 'Thomas Rawlinson,' he
deposited the parchment on the table, and leaning
against the frail wood-work of the Japanese <i>shoji</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
he lit a cigar, &quot;you will excuse me if I venture,
as a member of the family, to make a remark. In
my opinion this is an uncommonly rum sort of
will of yours. Deuced pleasant for Amy Mendovy,
I allow, and it is nice of you to have remembered
Rosina so extremely handsomely. But may I be
allowed to inquire where your future husband, de
Güldenfeldt, has a look in? It seems to me that
you have ignored his existence altogether.&quot;</p>

Sliding window.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Pearl flushed. &quot;I am not yet married to
Monsieur de Güldenfeldt,&quot; she murmured, &quot;and as
his <i>fiancée</i> I have certainly never for a moment
thought of leaving him my money. He does not
need it. He has plenty of his own.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doubtless,&quot; and Pearl blushed a deeper crimson
under the scrutiny of the keen eyes, &quot;but you
will, I suppose, in the natural course of events, be
married to him before many months have passed.
It is, I should have thought, hardly seemly to cut
him out entirely. Don't you agree with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
&quot;The date of our marriage is not yet fixed. I
am not married to him yet,&quot; she repeated, rather
helplessly. &quot;When--when we are married--nothing
will be easier, I suppose, than to make a
new will. In fact the old will does not hold good
in those circumstances. Besides, there will be the
settlements. I am perfectly aware that you mean
well, Tom. But don't distress yourself. I know
what I am about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, I'm blest if I do, and that's
flat!&quot; exclaimed Rawlinson. &quot;No shilly shallying,
I hope, my fair cousin. Let me tell you, once
for all, de Güldenfeldt is not the sort of fellow to
stand any confounded feminine nonsense. Pay
attention to what I say, my dear, and don't for
heaven's sake, behave like a fool.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl drew herself up, and her eyes flashed
ominously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really, Tom,&quot; she said, &quot;I think you--you--go
a little too far. You presume somewhat on our
relationship. I do not wish to believe that you
have any real intention of being rude or disagreeable,
but--well--to begin with, I never asked you
to read my will. And I don't believe for a moment
that it is usual for a witness to read through a will
before signing it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you, indeed! Well! I tell you it is
usual for Tom Rawlinson to do so. You needn't
have done me the honour of asking me to witness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
it if you didn't like the habit. But,&quot; he added,
seeing she still looked angry, &quot;don't let us wrangle
about such a trifle. You mustn't be vexed at my
plain speaking, Pearl. Remember, I stand <i>in loco
parentis</i> to you, and if that position doesn't give
me the right to offer advice and to speak my mind,
I don't know what should. But when, I should
like to know, did a woman ever take advice?
Nevertheless, I repeat I am puzzled with regard to
your treatment of de Güldenfeldt. He is a first-rate
chap, Pearl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! you dear old Tom, as if I didn't know
that. Am I likely to forget it, when the fact is
being everlastingly dinned into my poor ears?
How often have I not been told by you, and
Rosina, and Amy, that I am the luckiest woman
on the face of the earth to have succeeded in
securing such a treasure? It is not necessary to
impress this information so often, so very often,
upon me, I assure you, Tom. I am perfectly
aware of my good luck, and you may rest satisfied
that I have no intention whatsoever of forfeiting
such a prize. Nevertheless, in spite of your objections,
and of anything that you may consider
it your duty to say, my money, certainly for the
present, goes to Amy, and not to Stanislas. Why!
it was chiefly for that purpose and for the pleasure
of being able to leave it to her, that I decided to
accept that horrid fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
&quot;Indeed! Well, I suppose you know your own
wishes best. She's a lucky girl. Not that she is
ever likely to get it. Your life is as good as hers,
any day,&quot; with which farewell shaft Tom Rawlinson
took his departure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A queer woman, that Pearl,&quot; he remarked to
his wife that evening over his second glass of
port. &quot;Hysterical, and nervous and uncertain.
I wouldn't be in that poor fellow de Güldenfeldt's
shoes for all I'm worth. Not that she'll ever marry
him, that's one blessing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot; shrieked Rosina and Amy in chorus.
&quot;Oh, Tom, what do you mean?&quot; added his wife
tremulously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean what I say. At the last moment--she'll
wait till then, of course--but at the last
moment, Pearl Nugent will throw de Güldenfeldt
over. I warn you she has not the slightest intention
of marrying him. She finds it very convenient
to have a devoted idiot eternally dangling
after her. But she'll never come up to the scratch.
She's as shifty and as vacillating as you make 'em.
A most untrustworthy woman, I call her, in spite
of her prettiness, her money, and all the rest of
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You've disliked Pearl from the commencement,
Tom,&quot; replied Rosina as she rose from the
table, &quot;and of course nothing I may say will be
likely to change your opinion. But I really think,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
before making these rash assertions, you should
have some grounds to go upon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I by no means dislike your Pearl. In fact I
rather like her. But with regard to her heart
affairs, she--as a weak, vacillating member of your
sex,--in my opinion, takes the cake. Mark my
words, Rosina, my fair and fascinating cousin
Pearl will never be the wife of Stanislas de
Güldenfeldt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As he gets older your poor uncle's habit of
constantly repeating himself increases,&quot; remarked
Rosina, as she and Amy settled themselves in the
little rowing boat. &quot;He really is a most tiresome
man. This engagement of Pearl's is so very satisfactory
in every way. I was so enchanted about
it. And now he makes me wretched with those
horrid prognostications of his. I wonder what
can have induced him to take such an annoying
idea into his head. So shortly after everything
has all been comfortably settled, too. You don't
think that there is any ground for his fears, do
you, Amy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Amy was silent, while her eyes grew thoughtful.
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said after a minute, &quot;I think that
perhaps uncle is right. I am sure Pearl is not
happy, auntie. She tries her utmost to like Stanislas,
but nothing she can do will ever succeed in
making her really care for him. He has got on
her nerves. I can see that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
&quot;And he's such a dear, charming fellow, and so
absolutely devoted to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whereas, if he were a worthless but fascinating
scoundrel, who merely desired to marry her for
her money, she would probably adore him, and
be grovelling at his feet for a kind word. We
women are made like that,&quot; replied Amy, with a
worldly wisdom beyond her years.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, at any rate, your affairs and Ralph's are
all right. That's one comfort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm not so sure of that. I've discovered lately
that Ralph is by no means perfection, and as life
is far too short to devote time to the correction of
settled bad habits, I'm not at all certain, auntie,
but that in the end I may be reduced to the unpleasant
necessity of throwing him over,&quot; and
Amy's eyes gleamed with mischief as she glanced
up at her aunt and gave an extra strong pull at
the sculls.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Rawlinson's face for the space of a
moment was indicative of the deepest despair.
But bitter experience had taught her wisdom, and
she made no reply. She had long ago given up
attempting to fathom the intricate traits of her
young niece's character, or of trying to decide in her
own mind those moments when Amy meant
seriously or the reverse. Thus on the present
occasion she held her peace, and with a sigh of
resignation placidly folded her plump hands upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
her lap. Trusting that a merciful Providence
would take the matter up, she offered a secret
prayer that in spite of the perversity of a troublesome
niece, all might ultimately come right in the
end.</p>

<p class="indent">The Martinworths had taken possession of their
rooms in the hotel. Circumstances, however, had
so far arranged themselves that the inevitable
meeting between Pearl and Lord Martinworth
had not so far taken place. Pearl had on the
contrary been constantly thrown in contact with
his wife, the latter having contracted the habit of
running in and out of Mrs. Nugent's house whenever
an opportunity occurred. Pearl found her
looking both unhappy and ill, but though she
more than half divined the cause, Lady Martinworth
volunteered no information, rarely indeed
mentioning her husband's name. It was purely
incidentally that, in the course of conversation
one day, Pearl learnt that Lord Martinworth's
health was, in his wife's opinion by no means
satisfactory, and consequently, the cause of considerable
anxiety.</p>

<p class="indent">With that vague fear and dismay felt by Pearl
whenever she now thought or spoke of Martinworth,
she nevertheless nerved herself, on receiving
this intimation, to make one or two necessary
and polite inquiries.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope,&quot; she said rather formally, &quot;that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
are not seriously uneasy as to Lord Martinworth's
health? If so, this is the last place to bring him
to. We have no doctor up here, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Life is too short to fuss over people who
decline to be fussed over,&quot; replied Lady Martinworth
philosophically. &quot;Dick bites off my head
if I suggest he is out of sorts. So now I hold my
tongue. But the fact remains, his nerves are
completely unstrung, and he's jumpy to a degree.
His temper, too, has been unbearable ever since
he returned from that trip. I think it must be
the Japanese food that disagreed with him. He
lived on it for two months. And we all know the
digestion acts to a great extent on the temper and
the nerves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl smiled. &quot;I should say it is much more
likely to be the climate than the food. Nervous
people always come to grief in Japan. I should
get him away if I were you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Martinworth glanced sharply at Mrs.
Nugent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is most excellent advice, my dear,&quot; she
said dryly, &quot;and nothing would give me greater
pleasure than to follow it. But unfortunately
Martinworth possesses a will before which--from
my experience--everything and everybody
give way in the end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl changed colour, and turned the conversation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
It was some days after the above remarks
that Mrs. Nugent and de Güldenfeldt decided to
row half way down the lake to Shogonohama.
They beached their boat, wandering under the
shade of the maples, till they found themselves in
the little hut overlooking the waterfall. The rain
had poured in torrents for the whole of the day
and night before. The cascade, always beautiful,
was that day simply magnificent, and the sheets of
water crowned with their wreaths of snowy foam,
were tearing over the smooth surface of the rocks,
and across the fallen trunks of trees, in unbridled
and uncontrollable fury. The sight was a glorious
one, if somewhat appalling, and the noise was
deafening. Pearl and de Güldenfeldt sat close to
each other, silent and impressed, he half supporting
her with his arm, for the barrier against which
they leant--a frail and rotten bamboo--was their
only protection from sure and summary destruction.</p>

<p class="indent">The sight of rushing, roaring waters invariably
worked upon Pearl's emotions. The present
moment, with its many lovely accessories, a
brilliant blue sky, massive, fern-grown rocks, and
surrounding woods of every shade of green--stirred
her greatly, and combined in awakening
feelings that had long lain dormant in her heart.</p>

<p class="indent">With unusual demonstrativeness she turned towards
Stanislas, her lips parted, and her eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
shining like stars, and taking his hand between
her own, she laid it gently against her cheek.
Since their engagement, Pearl had volunteered
but few proofs of tenderness, and the present
action on her part was so spontaneous, so unexpected,
that Stanislas felt the blood surging up
into his head, and his heart throbbing, as in reply
he leant forward, and pressing her to him, he
kissed her passionately on the lips.</p>

<p class="indent">A moment later they both instinctively knew--for
they could hear nothing owing to the deafening
roar of the waters,--that someone was watching
them from behind. They turned simultaneously,
their eyes meeting those of Lord Martinworth
fixed upon them--while Amy Mendovy--apparently
extremely wretched and uncomfortable--was
standing by his side.</p>

<p class="indent">Arriving from an opposite direction and at that
unfortunate moment sharply turning a corner,
Martinworth and Amy had fallen thus upon the
unconscious pair, necessarily witnessing the whole
tender and silently acted scene.</p>

<p class="indent">At such a sacred moment, the last thing one
would ask is to be disturbed, and however true
and deep and absorbing may be a man's feelings
at the time, it is hardly a pleasant sentiment to
know that to the ordinary outside and amused
observer one must necessarily be looking somewhat
like a fool.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
And yet, to his intense annoyance, it was in
this undignified and unusual position that de
Güldenfeldt now found himself. Perhaps it was
only human nature that, being the sole person at
fault, his rage should straightway centre itself upon
one who so far had proved himself, except by his
uncalled-for and unfortunate arrival, entirely
inoffensive.</p>

<p class="indent">He took two steps forward in Lord Martinworth's
direction, and was about to pour forth a
flow of angry words and enquiries, when his
eloquence was abruptly nipped in the bud by the
expression on his would-be victim's face.</p>

<p class="indent">And, indeed, the transformation visible on that
countenance, which de Güldenfeldt had known so
well in former days, was enough not only to
astonish, but to paralyze the bravest man. For the
face was no longer human. It was almost that of
a fiend.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Martinworth was looking straight at
Pearl. His blue eyes, which she had always
known so soft and tender, so gentle and so kind,
gleamed wildly, seeming to be charged with lightning
under the contracting eyebrows. His mouth
was slightly open, and through the sneering lips
shone the white teeth, while the nostrils of the
delicate nose were quivering with excitement and
with rage. Features so transformed were sufficient
in themselves to terrify the most courageous. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
an expression of bitter, overwhelming hate and
fury, resting like a veil upon the livid face, completed
the appalling picture.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not say a word. He hardly seemed to
breathe. But he stood--for what seemed to the
spectators an endless period--staring at Pearl
Nugent with those frenzied eyes. With one hand
half-lifted before her, as if to shut off the sight,
and with the other clutching de Güldenfeldt's arm,
she looked back, white and trembling with fear,
yet as if half-hypnotised, into Martinworth's face.</p>

<p class="indent">At last the tension proving more than she could
bear, Pearl gave one little piteous moan, and sank
unconscious upon the earthern floor of the
shed.</p>

<p class="indent">This alarming occurrence roused all from the
spell that had hitherto held them silent and inactive.
Martinworth, casting one last look of infinite
hatred and contempt at the inanimate form, turned
and left the hut, while de Güldenfeldt and Amy,
bending over Pearl, and engrossed in their attempts
to restore her back to consciousness, hardly noticed
that he was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">For long their efforts seemed unavailing. But
at last Pearl slowly opened her grey eyes, smiling
sweetly at de Güldenfeldt as he leant over her.
Then consciousness and memory returning, the
terrified expression shadowed once more the pale
face.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
&quot;Where is he?&quot; she whispered, starting up.
&quot;Has he gone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, my darling, he has gone away,&quot; replied
Amy, taking the still trembling form in her arms.
&quot;You have nothing to fear, Pearl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is gone! And you did not kill him!&quot;
exclaimed Pearl, tearing herself from Amy's arms,
and facing de Güldenfeldt. &quot;Oh God! you let
him go? You did not kill him? And you call
yourself a man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas de Güldenfeldt's first expression of
surprise changed to one of sorrow. At the
moment it seemed to him that this most uncalled-for
and unexpected attack was a return of Pearl's
illness and delirium.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush! dear, hush!&quot; he said soothingly,
&quot;Why should I kill Martinworth? He did
nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You say he did nothing?&quot; she cried excitedly.
&quot;You saw the horrible way in which he looked
at me, and you say he did nothing? Oh, coward!--coward!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The blood flew into de Güldenfeldt's cheeks, and
he bit his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't excite yourself, Pearl,&quot; he replied quietly.
&quot;Of course, if you think Martinworth has insulted
you, he shall answer to me for it. Now come
home, for you are ill, dear, and it is getting late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl said no more, suffering herself to be led
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
between Amy and Stanislas, though she was still
trembling like a leaf when they placed her in the
boat. From the moment that she was seated in
the stern, Mrs. Nugent lapsed into gloomy silence.
Her former excitement, greatly to the relief of both,
appeared to have passed as quickly as it had risen.
She sat with her hands clasped on her knees,
staring out before her, but taking no notice of
passing objects.</p>

<p class="indent">The silent row home against a high wind seemed
endless. But at length they arrived at Mrs.
Nugent's house, and Amy, as a matter of course,
followed her cousin within its shelter.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas knew that with Miss Mendovy Pearl
was in safe and tender hands. But he looked very
white and drawn, and he heaved a deep sigh as
turning back into the boat he sculled himself
home.</p>

<p class="indent">From the moment that he and Amy had half
lifted her into the boat Pearl had completely
ignored his presence, nor had she answered, or
taken any notice whatsoever, of her lover's farewell
salutation.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas de Güldenfeldt had indeed paid dearly
for that one moment's happiness of the touch of
Pearl's soft hand upon his cheek!</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Danger-Signals.</span></p>

<p class="indent">Pearl was very silent and very pale during
dinner. As for Amy, she simply waited, for she
knew that in time her cousin must speak.</p>

<p class="indent">She was nevertheless hardly prepared for the
manner in which the conversation at length
opened.</p>

<p class="indent">The peaches were being handed round, when
Pearl, glancing suddenly at the girl opposite to her,
asked abruptly:--</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Amy, how was it that you went with Lord--with
that man to-day--so far from home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was taking a walk with him,&quot; replied Amy
quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems to me that you accompany him very
frequently in his walks, Amy. Ralph said the
other day that he saw much less of you now-a-days
than formerly, your time being so greatly
engrossed by Lord Martinworth. This sounds
very strange to me, considering the circumstances,
and I think, dear, if you will forgive my saying so,
you are playing rather a dangerous game.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Amy Mendovy did not reply for a minute,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
while she made little heaps on the table with her
bread crumbs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think,&quot; she said at length, and the colour
rose in her cheeks, &quot;if another time Ralph finds
that he has a grievance, it would be best if he
complained to me, instead of confiding in other
people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He didn't complain. He is far too loyal to do
that, whatever he may feel,&quot; retorted Pearl. &quot;But
I saw he was looking worried and out of sorts, so
I asked him what was wrong. If anyone is to
blame, it is I.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a time Amy seemed preoccupied. Then
she said in a low voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pearl, surely Ralph--surely you--do not think
that I--I am amusing myself with Lord Martinworth--that
I am flirting with him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl put her hand on her young cousin's
arm, for by this time they had risen from the
dinner table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know what to think, Amy,&quot; she
replied, with her grave, sweet smile. &quot;This
friendship seems so unusual, so--so strange.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless, it is easily explained,&quot; retorted
Amy quickly. &quot;I rather like Lord Martinworth, but
only <i>rather</i>, for he is often very peculiar, very odd.
I frequently find it difficult to make him out.
But of one thing I am sure--I never felt quite so
sorry for anyone in my life as I feel for him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
Pearl, that poor man is so desperately unhappy.
He worships you. Of course, it is all very wrong,
at least--I suppose it is. But I am sure it is
natural enough. What is more, I believe, poor
fellow, the worry is actually turning his brain.
He does and says such strange things, Pearl, and
is so morose. He has taken a fancy to me simply
and purely because I am one of your belongings.
And I, out of sheer sympathy--sheer pity--go for
walks with him, and have tried as much as I can
to cheer him up with my chatter and my nonsense.
So now you understand. As for flirting,
the idea is absurd. Why I never knew such a
silent, abstracted man. But he seems grateful to
me when I rattle along. And he brightens up a
little at times. I thought I was doing some good
for once in a way,&quot; she added plaintively, &quot;but
seem merely to have succeeded in placing myself
in a false position.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl merely sighed impatiently in reply. She
wandered aimlessly about the room, then fidgetted
with a piece of work, then opened a book,
but, almost as quickly closed it. At last she took
a lily from a flower vase and began abstractedly
pulling it to pieces. Finally, she went towards
her cousin, and placing her hand upon Amy's
arm, glanced up into her face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Amy,&quot; she said almost inaudibly, &quot;did you--did
you see that awful, that terrible look that he--that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
Lord Martinworth gave me to-day, when he
came upon Stanislas and myself in the hut?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Amy, without hesitation, &quot;I saw
it, dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Amy, I must tell you what I think. There--was--murder--in
that look!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl's eyes grew round with fear. She hurt
Amy's arm as she whispered these words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I felt it--I knew it,&quot; she added, &quot;and it was
the suddenness, Amy, of this overwhelming,
positive knowledge that made me faint away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush, dear, hush!&quot; replied Amy, putting
both arms round her. &quot;You are excited and
nervous. Your nerves are unstrung. You know
they never have been quite normal since your illness.
You are apt, darling, to fancy and exaggerate
things. You are thoroughly upset, Pearl.
He simply looked angry and surprised, dear, as
well he might, for, of course, he is ignorant of
your engagement to Stanislas. Seeing you
together in the hut--and--and--so affectionate--must
have been his first inkling of anything out
of the common.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Amy,&quot; exclaimed Pearl, unlocking the girl's
arms from about her waist, &quot;you are not speaking
the truth, and you know it. Don't you understand
that I, who have known Lord Martinworth
for so many years, have learnt by heart every look
of his eyes, every expression of his features. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
do you for a moment suppose that I have ever
seen that look, or anything like it, on his face
before? Never! And I pray God I may never
see it again. If I do, I know there can be no
possible escape for me. For as surely as I am standing
in this room, Dick Martinworth will kill me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At these tragic words Amy gave a little cry and
her lips grew pale. Both women lapsed into
gloomy silence, while Amy--once more placing
her arms tenderly round her cousin, drew her out
on to the verandah. They watched the moon in all
her glory, lighting up with mystic glow mountains
and woods and silent lake. The soft, mild light
seemed to have a soothing effect upon Pearl's
storm-tossed mind, for after a time she spoke
more calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course,&quot; she said, with a long-drawn sigh,
&quot;it was very, very wrong of me, just because I
was upset--half mad with fear--to behave as I
did to poor innocent Stanislas. I cannot now
understand how I could have called him--Stanislas--of
all men--a coward. How I could have
said those wicked things about his--killing--killing
the other one. I did not know, Amy, I had it in me
to be so hard, so unjust, so--so cruel. But lately I
have discovered more than one detestable trait in
my character unguessed before. Oh, dear, if you
only knew how I hate and scorn myself, how
cordially sometimes I wish I were dead!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
&quot;If,&quot; replied Amy, alarmed at this fresh outburst,
and speaking in her most calm and composed
manner, &quot;if you do not intend that Monsieur
de Güldenfeldt should carry out your wish of killing
Lord Martinworth, you had better perhaps, let
him know without further delay that you have
changed your mind. I believe people even in
these enlightened days, still sometimes fight
duels.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl looked startled, then she sighed wearily,
but made no reply. As the evening wore on she
grew calmer and more collected. But she did not
again refer to the subject, and by the time Amy
left her, all traces of excitement and tears had
vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas de Güldenfeldt had returned home
feeling thoroughly upset and distressed. Making
every allowance that he reasonably could for the
temporary excitement of an hysterical woman, he
still found it difficult not to feel wounded at
Pearl's behaviour, so uncalled-for and inconsiderate.
Of late, he had more than once noticed an
irritability and fractiousness of disposition, which
before her illness had certainly been unknown to
him. But this was the first time he had been
treated to such an outburst as that which followed
the unfortunate meeting with Lord Martinworth.
Even that, considering the circumstances, he
would have freely forgiven, for he knew that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
women suffered from a malady called nerves, and
at such times they were apt to do and say strange
things. What however, he found it difficult to
pardon and indeed to comprehend, was not only
her air of chilly reserve, but the persistent ill-temper
that Pearl had exhibited in the boat and even up to
the actual moment of their parting on the shore.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas de Güldenfeldt had yet to learn that
women's moods are incomprehensible in their
uncertainty, inexplicable in their variety.</p>

<p class="indent">From Pearl's misdemeanours, de Güldenfeldt's
thoughts flew to the ominous look witnessed on
Lord Martinworth's face. In recalling it to mind,
he was forced to acknowledge that the passion it
expressed was simply diabolical. He remembered
how this expression had staggered him as it crossed
his vision, how his blood had boiled to think
that such a glance should, even for one second,
fall upon the woman whom he loved. In pondering
over that look, and the circumstance that gave
rise to it, de Güldenfeldt was seized with fury,
and at that moment it was perhaps fortunate that
Martinworth was considerably beyond the reach
of the Swedish Minister's muscular arm. And yet,
as Stanislas grew calmer, he realised the difficulty
of going to the extremity of killing a man in a
duel, simply because the expression of his face
had been of an unpleasant nature, and had consequently
displeased him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
He was still debating this question in his mind,
wondering, as he puffed thoughtfully at his cigar,
what steps could possibly be taken, and gazing in
perplexity at the moon, which in its brilliancy
seemed to mock at his lugubrious thoughts,
when Sir Ralph Nicholson appeared on the
verandah.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a suppressed discomposure and
hurry in the latter's manner, and he was paler than
usual.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, de Güldenfeldt,&quot; he exclaimed, sinking
into a cane chair, &quot;we've had a devilish unpleasant
thing occur at the hotel. Martinworth has all but
cut his throat with his own razor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Sapristi!</i>&quot; exclaimed Stanislas under his
breath, half-rising from his chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fellow for the time being was evidently as
mad as a hatter,&quot; continued Ralph. &quot;Fortunately
for him, this charming little tragedy was enacted
in his wife's presence. I've no notion what called
it forth. There was a row between them, I suppose.
But I have gathered from her that he
suddenly rushed to the dressing table, and the
next thing she saw was the gleam of the razor
across his throat! She was up in a second, caught
hold of the beastly thing as he was in the very act,
had a tremendous struggle with him--she's a
strong woman, you know--eventually secured it,
and promptly pitched it out of the window.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
&quot;Good God! What a terrible business! Is
the wound serious?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was bleeding horribly when I rushed in.
Their rooms are next to mine, you know, and
through those thin partitions I heard the whole
affair--the struggle, her screams, etc. I was just
dressing for dinner. It appears, however, that the
wound is not very deep. His plucky wife prevented
that. Her hands are awfully cut about,
too. But she's kept her wits, and hasn't broken
down for a single instant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what have you done with Martinworth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! he's calm enough now. And sane
enough too, for the matter of that. Fortunately,
there is an army doctor on leave from Hong-Kong
staying at the hotel. He has bound up the wound,
and says that both Martinworth and his wife will
be all right in a few days. We've tried to hush
the affair up as much as possible, but of course
the story is bound to get about. The question is,
de Güldenfeldt, what on earth are we to do with
Martinworth?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think he ought to be put into confinement?&quot;
enquired de Güldenfeldt with a quick
look.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you see, a man who attempts his own
life is supposed as a rule to be hardly responsible
for his actions. Besides, I personally look upon
the fellow as a dangerous animal. Who knows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
but that the fancy may take him to attack someone
else instead of himself? He has been awfully
queer ever since he came up here, and I have not
at all liked Amy being so much with him. She
thought he seemed ill and unhappy, and kind-hearted
little soul that she is, felt sorry for him. I
blame myself now for not having sooner prevented
this intimacy. But naturally I felt a certain
delicacy at interfering in her friendships. But
that's neither here nor there. What on earth are
we to do with the poor fellow, de Güldenfeldt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two men discussed the question until far
into the night. Eventually what appeared like the
right,--indeed the only solution,--was arrived at.
They decided between themselves that as soon as
the wound was sufficiently healed to allow of his
removal, Lord Martinworth should be conveyed
without delay to the General Hospital in Yokohama,
in which place he could be detained in the
necessary confinement until it was found possible
to transfer him to England.</p>

<p class="indent">The plan was in every way a practical one.
But in forming it, neither de Güldenfeldt nor
Nicholson reckoned on the great opposition likely
to be raised by one of the chief persons concerned,
namely--the wife of the injured man.</p>

<p class="indent">The subject was approached by Ralph the next
morning, who with that purpose in view, begged
Lady Martinworth for a private interview. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
after a short time, looking pale and flustered, he
rejoined de Güldenfeldt, who was smoking his
cigar while waiting for him outside the hotel.</p>

<p class="indent">In emphatic terms he announced that never
again would he undertake such a mission, for he
had passed through one of the most painful, the
most unpleasant half-hours ever spent in his life.</p>

<p class="indent">It appeared that after considerable hesitation
and beating about the bush, Ralph came at length
to the point. At first--he told de Güldenfeldt--Lady
Martinworth did not appear to understand,
but that when she finally grasped his meaning her
anger was uncontrollable. She turned on Ralph,
and positively white with rage, asked him how he
dared to insult her and her husband--to say
nothing of the family of Martinworth generally--with
such an iniquitous proposition? She
affirmed over and over again, in the most angry
and positive terms, that Lord Martinworth was as
sane as Ralph himself, that in fact, the action
of the night before had merely been the result of
a temporary mental disturbance caused by an
unexpected shock, followed by great distress of
mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course,&quot; continued Ralph, &quot;I have no
notion to what she referred. And my belief is
she does not know herself what was the cause or
the nature of this shock. I ventured mildly to
insinuate that such an unfortunate state of affairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
might recur, in which case the danger might not
a second time be so easily averted. I was bound
to point this out to her, but it was an unfortunate
remark on my part, for on the strength of it,
what the dickens do you think she did?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on,&quot; replied his listener. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She caught me by the hand, dragged me across
the passage, and would you believe it, before I
caught on as to where she was going, ushered me
straight into Martinworth's room! He--poor
fellow--was lying on the sofa with his throat
bound up, though he really did not look half as
bad as one might have expected in the circumstances.
I went up to him at once. But Lady
Martinworth did not give me time to open my
lips. 'Dick,' she cried, 'I have brought Sir Ralph
Nicholson into your room for the express purpose
of proving to him what he declines to believe
from my lips--the fact that you are a sane man.
He affirms that you were mad last night when
this unfortunate accident took place, that you are
still mad, and what's more, that you are likely to
become worse as time goes on, and that consequently
precautions must be taken. He comes
here with a proposition which if not so insulting,
would really be downright absurd. I expect you
will have something to say in reply to both the
accusations and the remedy proposed. Of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
you must not talk, but write what you have to say
on this,' and pushing some note-paper towards
him, she cast a last furious glance at me, and then
and there left the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you can fancy, de Güldenfeldt, I felt a
bit of a fool standing there. Certainly my sentiments
for Lady Martinworth for having deliberately
forced me into such an unpleasant position
were not of the most amiable description. My
reasoning and accusations may have been perfectly
correct, still naturally, no fellow likes
being called a lunatic to his face, and I was quite
prepared for any amount of anger or violence on
Martinworth's part.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;However to my astonishment, he did not
seem at all put out. In fact he looked quite
agreeable, nodded and smiled, pointed to a chair,
and began writing at once. Here's his letter. I
confess, it doesn't look much like the production
of a madman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Ralph extracted from his pocket-book a
folded epistle, which he straightway handed to
de Güldenfeldt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;You are both right and wrong, my dear
Nicholson,&quot; it ran. &quot;Last night I was as
mad as people who are thoroughly sick of
life and are determined to end it--generally
are. The mood, the desire for self-extinction,
has however, passed. To-day I consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
myself perfectly sane, as sane as you
are yourself. Indeed, I now realise that I
have a purpose before me, and until that
purpose is accomplished I can assure you I
shall make no further attempt on my life.
And, even when my object is fulfilled, I
really see no particular reason why I
should wish to disappear. Shall I not
then have reached the height of my
desires? Therefore, why should I wish to
die?</p>

<p class="indent">But that is not the question now.
What I wish to explain to you is that there
is absolutely no reason whatever why I
should be shut up. For I presume it was
with that idea in your mind that you called
on my wife this morning? I perfectly
understand your view of the case. But <i>I
am not mad</i>. So you can go away, my
dear fellow, with the assurance that though
doubtless your intentions are excellent, they
are somewhat uncalled-for, and slightly
premature.</p>

<p class="right">Your decidedly amused,<br />
<span class="smcap">Martinworth</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">Come and give me a look sometimes.
I hope to be able to speak in a few days.
It will enliven me much to see your cheery
face.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
De Güldenfeldt looked serious as he returned
the letter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot agree with you, Nicholson,&quot; he
remarked after a minute or two, &quot;in considering
this communication the letter of a sane man.
Taking his previous acts into consideration, I
judge by this letter that he is more dangerously
cracked than I even at first imagined him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In what way?&quot; enquired Ralph.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear fellow, we all know the deepness and
cunning of a madman. And in my eyes that
letter is the acme of cunning. What, I should
like to know, does he mean by a 'purpose before
him?' What, I ask you, is that 'purpose?'
Mark my words, my dear Ralph, it means some
fiendish design, which, if the poor fellow were
sane, would probably be as far from his thoughts
or his intentions, as from yours or mine. Of
course, nothing can be done without the sanction
of his wife. But in my opinion, that man has no
right to be at large. Let him work out his 'purpose'
in an asylum if he likes. Not among the
peaceful community of Chuzenji.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I don't see what is to be done,&quot; replied
Ralph with a sigh. &quot;I only hope your suspicions
are unfounded, and that there may be no further
bother with him. At any rate, perhaps it will be
just as well to keep Amy away from him for the
present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
&quot;Yes, and above all--Pearl,&quot; remarked de Güldenfeldt
darkly.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas was particularly thoughtful as after
this conversation, he strolled towards Mrs.
Nugent's house. He did not attempt to disguise
from himself that he felt extremely anxious on
her account. He could not get Martinworth's
murderous look out of his mind. It haunted
him each time with greater vividness and
meaning, and the more clearly it imprinted itself
on his vision, the firmer was his impression that it
was the wild, vindictive, unreasoning look of a
madman.</p>

<p class="indent">He still seemed worried and preoccupied when
he appeared on Mrs. Nugent's verandah. That
lady, glancing quickly into his face as he went
towards her, naturally misconstrued the cause.</p>

<p class="indent">There were still moments when Pearl felt a
certain shyness and dread of her future husband.
The present was one of them.</p>

<p class="indent">She was paler than usual as she gave her cheek
to be kissed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stanislas,&quot; she said, still holding his hand, &quot;I
have been so ashamed, so unhappy at what occurred
yesterday. I am consumed with remorse.
Will you forgive me, dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Recent events had obliterated Pearl's misconduct.
Her words, however, recalled not only the
annoyance, but the considerable distress of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
she had been the cause. De Güldenfeldt's glance,
as it fell on her, was for once both cold and
stern.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If, Pearl,&quot; he said gravely, &quot;you hope in the
future to fill well your position as a Diplomatist's
wife, the first lesson you must learn is to control
not only your speech, but your temper. But let
us say no more about it,&quot; and his face softened
as his eyes rested on her repentant face and he
took in all her dainty loveliness. &quot;The man
frightened you. You were nervous and unstrung,
dear. Perhaps I was wrong to attach so much
importance to your irritability, or to be hurt at
your treatment of me. Certainly subsequent
events have proved that you were to a certain
extent justified in your alarm.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Pearl quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put on your hat and I will tell you in the boat.
There is a delicious breeze for sailing. It will take
us straight to Senji.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was only after much thought that de Güldenfeldt
decided to tell Pearl what had occurred at
the hotel. He was anxious not to increase her
fears. On the other hand, he knew that she must
hear the story sooner or later, and he concluded
that it were better she should get the true facts
from him than to have imparted to her from some
outsider a garbled and exaggerated version. Also,
he was anxious, without frightening her too much,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
to impress upon her the great necessity for being
on her guard, a task which, he knew, required both
tact and delicacy.</p>

<p class="indent">Altogether, Stanislas felt that he had a difficult
business before him. He was very desirous that
Mrs. Nugent should leave Chuzenji without delay.
He intended to use all his powers of persuasion
to convince her of the necessity for such a step,
and although he was prepared for many objections,
he little reckoned on the total failure of his
mission.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl's steering was erratic, and her startled
eyes looked brighter and bigger than ever, while
she listened in silence to all de Güldenfeldt
had to tell her. Hearing these distressing details
was a truly dreadful ordeal to her. At
each word Stanislas let drop, Pearl felt as if a
knife was being thrust into her breast. For, if
it were indeed true that Dick Martinworth were
mad, Pearl instinctively knew that she alone was
the cause of that madness. And as Stanislas'
grave, calm words fell upon her ears, and the
ghastly truth flashed upon her, that she--Pearl
Nugent--had driven a man insane for love of her,
she wept silently from very bitterness of soul.</p>

<p class="indent">So this was the sole result of her strivings, her
flight of three years ago, her struggle for respectability
and for virtue. So this--the mental
collapse of a man, once famous for his brilliant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
intellect, once noted for his calm impartial judgments--was
the climax, to what she in her self-satisfied
pride, had been wont to consider a fairly
successful victory over manifold temptations, a
triumph of entire self-control. It was but now, in
obtaining cognizance of his supposed insanity, that
Pearl fully appreciated the passionate, yet self-sacrificing
nature of Martinworth's devotion. She
realised at that moment, that it was this actual act
of self-renunciation that had caused the present
state of things, the unhinging of that once powerful
mind. Her frame shook as this thought was
brought home to her. That look of yesterday--everything--seemed
to be explained in those three
words, &quot;He is mad.&quot; He was mad. And she told
herself that it was she--Pearl Nugent--by her self-righteous,
cold, calm virtue and superiority, who
had driven him insane.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked out her eyes wide open with dumb
misery, at the blue expanse of water before her.
Her hand was leaning on the tiller, but she did
not move it. De Güldenfeldt watching her tears,
partly read and understood the remorse and agony
of mind through which she was passing.</p>

<p class="indent">He touched her with his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't take it so hardly, dear,&quot; he said. &quot;I
daresay he will get all right again. Indeed,
Nicholson thinks him so now, and you must
remember, he is the only one of us who has seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
him since this awful thing happened. Don't you
think you had better go away for a little, Pearl,
until all this has blown over? You will get ill
again if you worry so, if you take things so much
to heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go away? What should I go away for?
Where would you have me go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, up North,--anywhere. The Rawlinsons
and I would of course, accompany you. You
must get out of this place. You will get ill again.
You badly want a change, Pearl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want a change, when I have not been here a
month? No! I have no intention of moving for
the present. I am not ill, Stanislas. I am quite
well. All I implore is not to be bothered--to be
left in peace.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of her petulance, de Güldenfeldt persisted
for some time in his entreaties. Till
finally Pearl, glancing up at him with an expression
of bored surprise, informed him quietly but
incisively that his arguments were a mere waste
of breath, as she certainly had not the slightest
intention of leaving Chuzenji, where she was so
satisfactorily installed, until the hot season was
over.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you mind,&quot; she continued, &quot;once
more giving me your reasons why you are so
particularly anxious for me to exchange my
pleasant little abode here, where I am cool and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
perfectly contented, for the discomforts of hot,
stuffy tea-houses?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The reasons were not repeated. At that
moment the wind changed, and they had to put
about. Later, when they were comfortably settled
down again, Stanislas took a long look at Pearl's
firm, little chin. Not for the first time was it
borne upon the Swedish Minister's diplomatic
mind, the utter uselessness, the complete futility,
of trying to persuade Mrs. Nugent against her
will.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">Hidden Fires.</span></p>

<p class="indent">Prophets of misfortune are apt to experience a
decided sentiment of humiliation, perhaps a
sneaking disappointment and regret, when their
evil prognostications remain unfulfilled.</p>

<p class="indent">Monsieur de Güldenfeldt was, however, a pleasant
exception to the rule. In spite of the
catastrophe he had foretold, it was with genuine
relief that as time went on, he proved to his own
considerable satisfaction that the calm enjoyments
of Chuzenji were as far as he could see, in no
danger of being disturbed by the unmanageable
presence of a lunatic at large.</p>

<p class="indent">After each meeting with Lord Martinworth--and
they were necessarily many, for the invalid
was soon about again, and in this charming but
restricted mountain resort it is difficult to take a
stroll without running across all the world--Stanislas
confessed he could perceive no signs of
the malady that he feared. Indeed, as time
passed, and they met for at least a few minutes
every day, he concluded that not only was Martinworth
perfectly sane, but that he was certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
in manner and in appearance more intelligent,
more brisk and wide-awake than nine men out of
ten. He had known Dick Martinworth for many
years. But during the period of his former
friendship he failed to recall those signs of vivid
intellect and buoyant spirits, undeniable proofs of
which were constantly now being brought before
his notice.</p>

<p class="indent">It would seem as if the physical shock and pain
of his attempted suicide, instead of injuring had
on the contrary, acted as a tonic upon the moral
stamina of the man. From the moment that he
left his sofa he was to all outward appearances a
changed individual. Whereas of late months, he
had been morose and abstracted, gloomy, surly,
and unsociable, he suddenly developed traits of
quiet wit, constant good humour, charming affability,
and such a desire for the companionship of
his fellow creatures that it was not long before he
attained the, perhaps scarcely enviable position of
the most popular guest in the hotel.</p>

<p class="indent">He and his wife from this date, were constantly
seen in each other's society, a fact in itself
enough to strike those who knew him and the
circumstances of his marriage with considerable
wonder. She, poor soul, was consequently beaming
with happiness. There were more than a few
who were heard at this period of her existence,
to call Lady Martinworth actually good-looking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
which shows what a contented mind can sometimes
do for the improvement of homely features.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl and de Güldenfeldt would, in their walks
and expeditions, frequently run across the Martinworth
couple apparently on the most excellent
conjugal terms. They would stop and talk for a
few minutes, and the meetings would pass off
naturally and without unpleasantness. De Güldenfeldt
would, nevertheless, give a sigh of relief each
time these encounters were safely accomplished,
for with the appearance in the distance of
Martinworth and his wife, Mrs. Nugent would
turn white and dismayed, and while clutching
nervously at her <i>fiancé's</i> arm, her breath would
come and go in short, quick gasps.</p>

<p class="indent">No sooner, however, was she actually in Lord
Martinworth's presence than these signs of distress
would disappear, and Pearl would behave
with as much <i>sang froid</i> as any other woman of
the world placed in similar circumstances. Indeed,
it was an intense satisfaction to judge with
her own eyes that, in spite of de Güldenfeldt's
dreary prognostications, and indeed, in spite of
her own personal fears, there now seemed no
ground for their former gloomy apprehensions.</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Martinworth's condition was certainly, as
far as she could judge, absolutely normal. Realising
this, it was perhaps hardly a matter for
wonder that Mrs. Nugent felt slightly humiliated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
that so much wasted sympathy, such heart-rending
remorse, had been conferred on one who,
from all outward appearances, neither needed
nor seemingly expected further consideration
than is usually bestowed on a fellow creature
temporarily incapacitated or indisposed.</p>

<p class="indent">She could not but appreciate--though once
again she experienced a faint surprise--Martinworth's
tact and delicacy in making no attempt to
thrust himself into her presence. He had not
called either before or since what was now
generally spoken of as his &quot;accident,&quot; and in
recalling the dread she experienced when she
first heard of his expected arrival at Chuzenji, of
her fear of constant importunities, frequent visits,
vain protestations, Pearl could not but smile--rather
drearily and cynically, it is true--at these
apprehensions, apparently so entirely uncalled-for,
and premature.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus were the fears of all repressed and allayed.
Lord Martinworth, as was only right and proper,
devoted himself to his wife. Monsieur de Güldenfeldt
was seldom absent from Mrs. Nugent's side,
and Sir Ralph Nicholson, after a laughing remonstrance
on Amy's part, at what she declared was
a far too premature exhibition of masculine appropriation,
was happy once more in the undisputed
society of the girl he was to marry. The quiet
every-day life, the innocent, healthy out-door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
pleasures of Chuzenji, pursued their natural and
their agreeable course. Everyone seemed contented
and at ease. There were no disputes, no
excitements, no disturbances, and probably
matters would have continued thus satisfactorily
till the end of the season had it not been that one
member of the little community was obliged to
acknowledge that delicious dallying through those
long, lovely summer days, and the enjoyment of
charming society and the peaceful pleasures of
the country were, alas! not the only ingredients
that constituted life.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas de Güldenfeldt's official duties called
him to the Capital.</p>

<p class="indent">He parted from Pearl with a lingering regret,
tempered with an anxiety he did not attempt to
conceal. At the moment of his departure, all his
former fears of Martinworth which had been lying
dormant for so many weeks were renewed, and
the knowledge that he was leaving his future wife
alone and unprotected induced him once more to
urge upon her a temporary absence from
Chuzenji. She, however, definitely refused to
contemplate his proposal, and nothing he could
say would move her from her decision. De
Güldenfeldt was offered instead, one sole consolation.
On the eve of his departure, he at last
succeeded in extracting from Pearl a reluctant
promise that their marriage should take place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
shortly after the general return to Tokyo. This
concession had, to a certain extent, relieved
de Güldenfeldt's mind, for it was the first time
since their engagement that Pearl--in spite of his
many attempts--had allowed him to touch on the
all-important subject of the date of their marriage.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Nugent was wise enough to understand
that it was necessary to concede something. She
could not for ever be refusing her lover's every
suggestion, every wish, and she reassured herself
with the thought that it was now but the end
of August. The middle of October still seemed
to her a very long way off. Much might happen
before then.</p>

<p class="indent">And so Stanislas rode off down the pass,
partially consoled. It was only Pearl watching
his vanishing figure from the tea-house to which
she had accompanied him, who once more found
herself recalling with a sickening dread that
threatening look which for so long had haunted
her nights and embittered her days.</p>

<p class="indent">For even as Pearl watched her lover from afar
guiding his horse down the zigzag path, she felt
again that strange feeling of coming evil that
assailed her when de Güldenfeldt had proposed
to her under the shadow of the Shogun's tomb.
It attacked her now with renewed force. And
some Power, which she could not explain, induced
her to cry his name aloud.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
He heard her, and turned in his saddle. Her tall
figure, clad in a white gown, stood out clearly
against a background of dark pines. Her arms
were stretched towards him, and even at that
distance he could distinguish the general fear and
unrest enveloping her person.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stanislas,&quot; she cried, &quot;come back to me. I
want you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He put his horse to a canter, and was soon by
her side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, my darling?&quot; he said dismounting,
and going up to her he took her two hands in
his, and gazed steadily into her face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stanislas,&quot; she whispered,--and she put her
arms round his neck, hiding her head on his
breast,--&quot;forgive me, dear, for calling you back.
But I felt so sad, so lonely, so frightened, and I
wanted to tell you before you left how much--how
very, very grateful I am, for all your goodness
to me. I have never told you this before,
Stanislas. But I felt I could not let you go without
assuring you that I will try to prove my
gratitude by being a good wife to you. I will indeed.
No one has ever been so kind to me as you
have been. No one has been so gentle, so tender,
so forbearing. And yet <i>I</i> know I have often been
trying, capricious, unreasonable. I have rewarded
you but badly, darling, for all your kindness--your
great goodness to me. Do you think me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
very horrid, Stanislas?&quot; and she looked up at
him, her lovely eyes clouded with tears.</p>

<p class="indent">It is unnecessary to give Monsieur de Güldenfeldt's
reply to this question.</p>

<p class="indent">Once more he rode down the path, his face
aglow and his heart lighter than he had felt it for
many weeks past. Whilst Pearl, sad and sorry,
wended her way slowly home, and throwing herself
on her knees by the side of her bed, burst
into an uncontrollable fit of weeping.</p>

<p class="indent">It was in this melancholy condition that Rosina
found her half-an-hour later. Mrs. Rawlinson
asked no questions. But she took her cousin in
her arms, and kissed and soothed her, and stroked
the tight little auburn curls that since Pearl's
illness had taken the place of the magnificent
tresses for which she had once been famous. She
knew well enough what was troubling Pearl, for
ever since her husband had opened her eyes, she
for weeks had silently watched the struggle which
she saw was being fought out within her cousin's
breast. She deeply pitied her, but she understood
that she could not force her confidence--that she
must wait for her to speak. And now at length
the moment had come. Ere long Pearl had unburdened
her whole soul to the friend who had
never proved her false. She told her cousin everything.
Nothing was left unconfessed, from the
moment that Lord Martinworth had once more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
crossed her path, to her parting that day with
Stanislas de Güldenfeldt.</p>

<p class="indent">And when she had finished a long silence
ensued between the two women, for Rosina
knew not what comfort to hold forth.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl had shed all her tears, and with hands
crossed upon her knees was gazing out with
mournful eyes at the distant mountains and the
blue, sunlit lake.</p>

<p class="indent">At last she spoke again in short sharp sentences.
&quot;Tell me, Rosina,&quot; she said, &quot;what am I to do?
How am I to marry Stanislas? I do not love
him. I can never love him. I have tried so
hard, and at one time when he asked me again I
thought it would be so easy. Why do I not care
for him? He is lovable enough, heaven knows!
I dare not tell him that I cannot marry him. I
dare not. I dare not. It would, I know, break
his heart--that heart which is of pure gold. I
had my chance to-day, when he insisted on my
fixing the date of our marriage. But coward that
I was, I left all that I ought to have said unsaid.
Now I am in a worse position than ever. We are
to be married in the middle of October, Oh!
Rosina, what am I to do? Tell me, dearest, what
am I to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is,&quot; replied Mrs. Rawlinson, rising
from her seat, and speaking very quietly, &quot;only
one thing, Pearl, to be done. If you feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
like this you must discontinue the engagement.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot, I cannot! I tell you it will break
his heart. It will kill him. He is not a boy, and
I don't think he has ever cared very much for anyone
before. He is sacrificing much, I know, to
marry me. Oh, Rosina! if you only knew how I
like him, how I respect--admire him, take pleasure
in his society--everything, but--love him. If
he would only be satisfied with these things.
But once we are married he will, of course, look
upon my love as his lawful right, and oh! how
shall I be able to endure it? How shall I, in
these circumstances--yielding nothing--giving
nothing--be able to live with him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Pearl,&quot; replied Mrs. Rawlinson,
taking her cousin's hand between her own, and
looking at her steadily with her clear brown eyes,
&quot;it is no good going over the same ground time
after time. You must realise one thing. You
must either make up your mind to marry Stanislas
de Güldenfeldt, or else you must break if off <i>at
once</i>. Now, if you feel that this marriage is impossible
for the reasons that you give, you must
have the strength of mind to write immediately,
and put an end to the matter. He will suffer, but
people nowadays do not die of broken hearts.
Whereas if you marry, not loving him--obliged to
live in daily intercourse fulfilling your duty as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
wife, your life will be a torture. He, of course,
will soon understand what you are going through,
and there will be unhappiness and misery on both
sides. I repeat, if you feel certain, dear, that you
can never give him that love that he will expect
as his right, there is only one course to follow. It
will, believe me, be kinder to him in the end.
Stanislas de Güldenfeldt is not a man to be
trifled with. He is not a man to rest satisfied with
half measures. If I remained in your house a
week, Pearl, I should only repeat the same thing.
So good-bye, my darling. Be brave. Follow
my advice, and write to him without further
delay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Rawlinson pondered greatly as she wended
her way homewards. She wondered much
whether Pearl would be guided by her advice,
and, knowing human nature fairly well, the conclusion
at which she ultimately arrived was--that
she would not.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She will marry him,&quot; she thought, &quot;and they
will, I suppose, both be thoroughly wretched for
the rest of their days. And I, who was so pleased
at this match! Really, Pearl is very tiresome.
Why on earth can't she be reasonably and comfortably
in love like anybody else? But one
can't alter one's disposition, I suppose. As
things are, such a marriage for both parties concerned
is simply suicidal. Dear me! how Tom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
will chuckle when I tell him of this interview.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And he certainly did.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This comes,&quot; he said, &quot;of your mixing yourself
up in such affairs. Didn't I tell you you
would burn your fingers? Didn't I tell you, that
though obstinate enough on certain points, on
matters connected with her heart Pearl never
knew her own mind two days running? And
didn't I tell you that marriage number two would
probably prove as great a <i>fiasco</i> as marriage number
one? Never mind, my dear, you will meet
with your reward, for in less than a couple of
years you will probably have the delightful excitement
of all the scandal of another divorce,
or at least a separation. De Güldenfeldt is not a
man to stand any damned nonsense, I can tell
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Certainly, Mr. Rawlinson was an extremely
annoying, disagreeable sort of husband. Such
was Rosina's decided, and perhaps justifiable
opinion at that moment.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, with regard to the writing of the
proposed letter of dismissal, Mrs. Rawlinson was
perfectly correct in her surmises. It was--though
often enough commenced--never accomplished.
Day after day Mrs. Nugent would make up her
mind to put an end to the existing state of things,
and day after day matters remained exactly as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
they were. At last the time approached for the
return of her future husband, and still the letter
was unwritten. Pearl adopted the habit of indulging
in long, solitary walks, and dejected rows on
the lake, every day finding her more care-worn,
paler and thinner, and Count Carlitti, who paid
her many visits at this time, became more and
more concerned about her state of health and
loss of animation and good looks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must tell you, <i>mon ami</i>,&quot; he said to
Ralph in a moment of confidence, &quot;I intended a
week or two ago to declare myself. Because you
know she is <i>une ravissante et charmante femme</i>.
My heart did beat each time I did see her. Yes,
I would have made her <i>la Comtesse Carlitti</i>. She
was worthy of my name and title, and leetle fortune.
But now, <i>que voulez vous?</i> her beauty fades.
Every day it does vanish a leetle more, and
perhaps--<i>qui sait?</i> one day she will become only
a savage flower--no longer <i>une rose, la reine des
fleurs</i>. So I have decided now, <i>mon cher</i> Nicholson,
not to tell her of my honourable intentions.
Do you not give me right?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite right,&quot; replied Ralph, &quot;but I am sorry
for her, poor thing. It will, you know, be a cruel
disappointment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Monsieur Carlitti, who was by no means the
fool that some people gave him the credit for
being, looked up sharply.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
&quot;Ah! <i>farceur!</i> now you do mock,&quot; he said. &quot;I
will no longer hesitate, but will ask her to-day.
And to-morrow I will announce to you my
wedding. <i>Elle est adorable!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do lofe you,&quot; he said to Pearl that afternoon,
having to his great satisfaction found her alone in
her little white drawing room. &quot;I do lofe you
<i>excessivement</i>. I have lofed you from the first day
that I met you at <i>la fête de la Légation de France</i>.
It will give me a happiness <i>immense</i> to make you
<i>la Comtesse Carlitti</i>. I know that you are <i>une
divorcée</i>. <i>Mais n'importe, vous êtes si belle et si
séduisante.</i> And I do lofe you. That is enough.
We shall make <i>trés bon ménage</i>. You will share
with me my leetle fortune, and I likewise your
fortune will participate with you. <i>Un arrangement
bien commode.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl never for an instant doubted but that the
arrangement would indeed be extremely convenient,
especially for the male participator thereof,
her fortune being at least ten times larger than
that of her admirer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will suicide myself,&quot; he said mournfully,
after she in all gentleness, but with a smile in her
eyes which she vainly tried to suppress, had
refused the honour of this noble alliance; &quot;I
will burn myself the brain. <i>Je suis trop malheureux.</i>
For I had said to myself, '<i>cette belle
Madame Nugent</i> is worthy of the ancient name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
Carlitti, and of my leetle fortune.' And now you
do me decline. You do say 'No.' So I will
suicide myself. Yes, I will go on the lake, <i>ce beau
lac de</i> Chuzenji, and you--cruel one--will never,
never see me more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Not much anxiety was experienced by Mrs.
Nugent at these threats of her volatile and flighty
adorer. To no one did she mention the details of
this interview, or the melancholy result of Count
Carlitti's matrimonial attempt. As for Ralph, he
was by far too kind-hearted to think of putting
his sanguine friend to the torture of answering
painful questions.</p>

<p class="indent">Indeed, the unusual droop of the finely waxed
and pointed moustache, the plaintive look in the
soft, brown eyes--and the general limpness and
depression that for two whole days enveloped
the person of the ordinarily vivacious little man,
told their own sad tale.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">A Bird of Ill Omen.</span></p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas de Güldenfeldt, the subject of so much
heart burning, was meanwhile, in the scorching
heat of Tokyo, striving as speedily as possible to
accomplish the business that had called him to
the Capital. It was a tiresome affair that compelled
appointments with Ministers and endless
interviews with men of business, the latter frequently
necessitating the presence of an interpreter--at
the best of times a wearisome and tedious
performance, and especially so when the thermometer
marks, as it frequently did during that
torrid summer--97° in the shade. In spite of his
somewhat dreary occupations, there were many
weary hours of enforced idleness, and the time
had to be killed as best it could, a difficult
operation with scarcely a creature--much less an
acquaintance or a colleague--left in town.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas' love of reading and research seemed
to be a thing of the past. His own life's drama
struck him at this time as being so far more
thrilling and absorbing than the perusal of any
treatise or romance, or even the study of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
favourite scientific authors who--until now--had
proved the great resource and stand-by of his
lonely hours. He no longer had taste for these
former delights, and though a once beloved
volume might be taken from the bookshelves
adorned by the work of many an ancient and distinguished
author, instead of being dipped into,
studied, or perused, it would remain for hours
unopened on his knees.</p>

<p class="indent">Thoughts of Pearl, plans for the future, hopes
for the future and--on frequent occasions--fears
for the future, engrossed instead his mind. Mrs.
Nugent's recent and fairly constant fits of
irritability had by no means escaped the observation
of de Güldenfeldt. Though, so far, he had
hardly succeeded in fathoming the true cause of
this strange and uncomfortable deviation in a disposition
which--he was wont to flatter himself--he
had after three years' study thoroughly solved--he,
nevertheless, genuinely lamented the existence
of these--until now--concealed and undreamt-of
traits of character. More than once had he been
brought into intimate contact with these uncertain
and capricious moods. More than once had he
suffered from these fits of nervous excitement,
indulged in by one whom he hitherto had considered
not only the sweetest and the best, but,
above all, an unusually just and reasonable
specimen of her sex.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
He at times consoled himself with the thought
that once married, once leading the daily routine
of a calm and settled existence--Pearl would
regain that former buoyancy of spirits, that
previous equanimity of temperament which in
his eyes, had constituted the greater part of her
fascination and her charm.</p>

<p class="indent">He felt he had indeed achieved much in getting
fixed the approximate date of the wedding. He
recalled the sweet face which he had kissed so
ardently when Pearl had summoned him back on
the mountain pass, and the delicious words of love
and repentance that in the fulness of her heart,
with her arms encircling his neck, she then had
uttered,--and his pulses beat, and once more his
heart throbbed with joyful anticipation at the
thought of that happiness which--he flattered
himself--must surely one day be his lot.</p>

<p class="indent">He longed with an indescribable longing to be
back to her. And it was with genuine relief that
he saw the termination of his business approaching,
and knew that those dreary days of enforced
absence from her side must soon be reckoned as
among the dark chronicles of the past.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the beginning of September and a most
unusual season for the visit of the ubiquitous
globe-trotter. Stanislas was therefore considerably,
but none the less most agreeably, surprised,
when one morning, just at the time he was feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
his dullest and forlornest, a note was brought him
from the Imperial Hotel, announcing the arrival--accompanied
by a young son and daughter--of a
former London friend, and a connection of his
English mother's, a certain Mrs. Millward-Fraser.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;We arrived in Japan by the last 'Empress'
a fortnight ago&quot; she wrote, &quot;and
have since been hard at work doing the
sights of this most fascinating city. We
called at the Legation, but were told that
you were ruralising in the hills. Now we
hear that you have returned to Town, so we
allow ourselves to hope that you will look
in upon us one day soon. It will be so
pleasant to meet again, and to talk over
family news,&quot; etc., etc., etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Stanislas went promptly, that same day, to see
his old friend. And an invitation to lunch at the
Swedish Legation for the following morning was
the outcome of the visit.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Millward-Fraser had been reckoned a
beauty in her day, and was still a very good looking
woman. She was a widow, having lost her
husband, an energetic and well-known M.P., a few
years previously. Stanislas had known the family
intimately during the years he was posted in
London, and in those days was not only a valued
friend of the elders, but an equal favourite with
both boy and girl. Since those jolly days of romps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
and fun, Alfred, the son, had emerged from Eton
a cheerful, fairly well mannered, and fairly well
educated, though somewhat raw stripling--while
the daughter Muriel had developed into a bright
and extremely pretty young woman, of which
beauty she had indeed given full promise in her
juvenile days.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You bring it forcibly before my mind into
what a regular old buffer I am degenerating,&quot; de
Güldenfeldt remarked to the latter as they strolled
into lunch, &quot;and yet it only seems the other day
since I nursed you on my knee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless, it is ten years ago at the very
least,&quot; laughed the girl. &quot;I am seventeen now,
and I am firmly convinced that I never permitted
such a liberty after the age of seven or eight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And a nice fat lump you must have been even
at that age. I pity poor cousin Stanny if he often
indulged in the amusement of dancing you
up and down on his knee,&quot; chaffed young
Millward-Fraser, with brotherly politeness and
candour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alfred, it was impressed upon our minds
by Mamma when we were children that personal
remarks were considered particularly odious,&quot;
retorted his sister. &quot;Do you think me so very
fat, cousin Stanislas? Ally is always teasing me,
and laughing at me for being what he calls
'rotund.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
Stanislas, thus appealed to, looked admiringly
at the pretty plump girl beside him and laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are perfectly enormous,&quot; he said; &quot;a
female Tichborne in fact. Fortunately there are,
however, many men who, like myself, admire 'a
little plump partridge.' Wait till you see Carlitti.
He'll not hesitate long in falling a slave to your
charms.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is Carlitti?&quot; enquired Mrs. Millward-Frazer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Count Carlitti is a colleague of mine. A dear
fellow, and an immense admirer of your sex, and
extremely susceptible in consequence. He is
bound to lose his heart to Muriel, when he
meets you all, as he will no doubt do later, at
Chuzenji.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Talking of hearts reminds me, Muriel, that
we have forgotten the fortune-teller. You know
we arranged to go there to-day,&quot; exclaimed
Alfred.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear children! such nonsense. He will
only cram your head with fables,&quot; remonstrated
Mrs. Millward-Fraser.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dearest mother, we have come here to study
the habits and customs of the country. No one
would dream of leaving Japan without visiting
one of its famous soothsayers. Would they,
cousin Stan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I blush to confess, Muriel, that during all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
years I have lived in the East I have never, so far,
penetrated into the sacred precincts of a fortune-teller's
house,&quot; replied de Güldenfeldt as they
seated themselves on the verandah, where coffee
was served. &quot;But then, you know, it is always
the G.T.'s who see and do everything. We poor
ignorant residents are very much behind the
times, and are unacquainted with half the sights
of Tokyo.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Better late than never,&quot; said Muriel. &quot;Come
with us to-day. They are really marvellous
people, you know. I have the address of a particularly
clever one, much consulted by the
Japanese.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn't it rather hot for such exciting interviews?&quot;
feebly remonstrated Stanislas, knowing
all the time that when once Miss Muriel took it
into her pretty head to command, the sole thing
was to surrender with a good grace. So, without
further discussion, the carriage was promptly
ordered.</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of the heat the young people were in
the highest spirits during their drive, seeming
greatly to enjoy the brightness and animation of
the crowded streets, as the <i>betto</i>,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
 with his peculiar
warning cry, cleared the way which led to the
picturesque suburbs of the city. It was with
regret when, after over an hour's transit, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
carriage stopped before a black wooden ancient
gateway, and they knew that they had arrived at
the entrance to the <i>Ninso mi's</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;I feel as if I were leaving the Occidental, the
modern existence behind me. It is all so old-world
and weird,&quot; whispered Muriel to her
mother, as they proceeded from under the gateway
and entered the quaint, well-kept garden.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a lovely, poetical little garden, restful and
secluded. Its many narrow paths were paved
with grey pebbles, and in the centre of a plot of
bright green turf was a miniature lake or pond
edged with divers shrubs of various sizes and
shapes. Uprising from the lake was a tiny
island, on which flourished equally tiny and
twisted maple, plum and cherry trees, shrined by
one gnarled and quaint shaped pine, many centuries
old. Floating on the surface of the little
pond, and swaying gracefully in the summer
breeze, were regal lotus plants, some bearing,
amidst their glossy cup-shaped leaves, giant
flowers of soft rose-pink, while other plants were
crowned with marvellous white blossoms, standing
erect on their long stems.</p>

<p class="indent">August is the month in which the lotus plants
are in full and glorious flower, and the travellers
were in raptures at the richness of growth,
their delicate loveliness, as their eyes rested on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
this entrancing and, to them, unknown sight.
The party lingered long on the large flat stones
that forming a natural bridge, traversed the pond,
gazing with unbounded admiration at these unrivalled
bell-shaped flowers. The colossal leaves
of green almost as striking as the lovely blossoms
themselves, were full to overflowing of glistening
dewdrops, that sparkled like diamonds in the
afternoon sun, as the plants swayed gracefully
above the water with every breath of the quiet
air.</p>

<p class="indent">The Millward-Frazer family at length tore
themselves away from admiring these lovely blossoms
and left the garden. The party passed
through the grotesquely carved porch of the
old-fashioned building, with its many gabled,
peaked Chinese roof, and were received by a servant,
who, after greeting them kneeling and with
her forehead touching the threshold of the doorway,
rose, assisted in taking off their shoes, and
finally ushered them into a fairly sized Japanese
room. The <i>shoji</i> were wide open, acting as a
simple frame to the picturesque garden without,
its gnarled and twisted trees, its ancient stones
and lanterns, and its pond of slumbering lotus
blooms.</p>

<p class="indent">In the middle of the matted room, which--with
the exception of the little shrine before which the
evening and morning prayers are offered up--was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
almost devoid of furniture, was a square lacquer
table that rose about a couple of feet from the
floor, and on which was piled a heap of ancient
volumes. Before the table, with huge horn spectacles
perched on his nose, and with a glistening
and entirely shaven pate, was squatting on his
heels, a wrinkled and solemn looking Bonze of
benign countenance, holding upright in his hand
a partly opened fan. He was adorned in the
richest vestments of purple silk, which stuck out
in stiff, straight lines around his bending body.</p>

<p class="indent">As each of the visitors filed in, filling the little
room, the old priest from behind his great round
spectacles examined them from head to foot with
the piercing eye of an eagle. His glance finally
fell and rested on the interpreter of the Legation,
a young man whom Stanislas had recently
appointed to fill the post left empty by poor
Suzuki's tragic death.</p>

<p class="indent">From studying the impassive face of Ito, the
old man's eyes travelled to de Güldenfeldt, on
whom they remained, though the latter made vain
attempts to keep himself as far as possible in the
background.</p>

<p class="indent">The Bonze, never once taking his eyes from
Stanislas, murmured something to Ito in a low and
impressive manner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The <i>Ninsomi-san</i> says he wishes to interview
you first,&quot; Ito said, turning to his master. &quot;He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
has something of the utmost importance to say to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nonsense,&quot; replied de Güldenfeldt impatiently.
&quot;He can have absolutely nothing to say. Why,
it is impossible for him to know even who I am.
Besides, I pay no attention to such things, and
have no intention whatsoever of having my fortune
told. Miss Millward-Fraser wishes to hear her
fate. He will speak to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The message was transmitted, and the old man,
mournfully nodding his head, said the <i>Danna
sama</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
 should be obeyed; but that later he would
himself be the first to regret the unnecessary
delay. He begged humbly to be allowed to say
what he had to say to the <i>Danna sama</i> immediately
after he had spoken to the <i>O' Fo-sama</i>.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Muriel thereupon knelt on the floor in front of
the table, and the old Seer, wrinkling up his face
and closing his narrow eyes, devoid of eyelashes,
mumbled and muttered incantations between his
toothless lips. She held out the palm of her hand.
He did not even glance at it, but lifting the divining
rods reverentially and solemnly to his forehead,
he for a moment leant his forehead in deep
thought on-to the table, always muttering and
groaning to himself. After this performance he
slowly raised his bald old head looking at Muriel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
with a quick and comprehensive glance. He next
enquired her age, and reckoning by the Japanese
signs of the Zodiac, he parted the divining rods
into two bundles, then taking up the magnifying
glass, he examined intently the lines of the face. So
intently and so long indeed did he gaze as to
considerably embarrass poor Muriel, who blushed
furiously under this prolonged examination of
her features. He seemed apparently satisfied
with this inspection, for a grim smile gleamed
from his cunning old eyes, and he proceeded
to count the number of twigs in each of the
already separated packets of divining rods.
Then once more he took the magnifying glass,
and carefully re-examining her face he spoke,
pausing every now and then to allow the interpreter
to translate his prophecies.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have,&quot; he mumbled in a low monotone,
interspersed with various &quot;oh's&quot; and &quot;ah's,&quot; and
a curious hissing sound between the wrinkled lips,
&quot;you have crossed many miles of water&quot;--(&quot;I
could have told you that,&quot; whispered Alfred
Millward-Fraser, &quot;without having the honour of
being a Japanese soothsayer&quot;)--&quot;but you will not
cross it again for many months, and perhaps
years.&quot;--(&quot;Why, we are returning home in three
months,&quot; continued the irrepressible youth.)--&quot;In
a few days you will travel to a country high
in the hills, a beautiful fertile country, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
there is much water and beautiful vegetation, but
a dangerous and difficult journey over rocks and
fallen trees and broken bridges. You will meet a
male, a stranger, on the road, and before two
months have passed and gone, you will have told
that man that you will become his wife. The
ninth month and the tenth month of this year of
Meiji will be your most fortunate months. They
will bring you much happiness. You will have a
long and happy and healthy life, for your pretty
face is likewise a lucky face, and much money
and many children and good fortune will be your
lot. I have spoken.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The young girl's eyes were sparkling with
excitement and merriment as she rose from her
lowly seat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How wonderful it is,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I am
actually to meet my fate in a few days. Do you
hear, Ally? you, who are always scoffing and
telling me I shall never succeed in securing a
husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bosh! I bet you ten dollars, Muriel, it is all
humbug,&quot; said Alfred, boy-like, ashamed to show
how much impressed he was.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt. But what delightful humbug,
nevertheless. Now, Cousin Stanny, it is your
turn. He is looking at you all the time. He
evidently finds you by far the most interesting
member of the party. I am sure I have suffered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
by this absorbing interest, and that he has cut my
fortune short in consequence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, to please you, Muriel,&quot; replied
de Güldenfeldt with a smile. &quot;But pray don't
run away with the notion that I for one instant
believe in this nonsense. Alfred is right. It is all
humbug from beginning to end. I sacrifice
myself on the sole condition that your mother
promises to be the next victim.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Millward-Fraser smiled rather sadly and
shook her head. &quot;I live in the past, not in the
future,&quot; she said, as de Güldenfeldt, folding up
his long legs as best he could, squatted down in
front of the little table, and prepared himself to
be scrutinized.</p>

<p class="indent">This time, however, the Seer employed neither
magnifying glass nor divining rods. He looked
steadily at Stanislas for a few minutes with his
penetrating black eyes. Then turning to the interpreter
he spoke rapidly, in a low sing-song voice,
charging his monologue with many ominous shakings
of the head, and with dreary groans and sighs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Ito, what does he say?&quot; asked de
Güldenfeldt, when the old man, ceasing to speak,
leant his head on the table in a state of breathless
exhaustion. The interpreter hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me, your Excellency, but he says
many bad, many false things. Do you wish me to
repeat them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
&quot;Certainly,&quot; and de Güldenfeldt laughed rather
uneasily, &quot;let us hear everything. Keep nothing
from me, false or true, good or bad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In what he says there is no good, no truth,
Excellency. It is all bad, all false words. He
says that you must hasten away up into the hills.
He says the wind is rising, that it is already
beginning to sing in the trees, and that there will
be a great and terrible storm. The storm in the
mountains will be a raging tempest, very, very
dreadful and destructive. He says that one whom
you love will be in the midst of it, at the mercy of
the wind and of the waves, and what is worse, at the
mercy of a man who is mad, of a man who hates
you with a great and bitter hatred. You must go
to her, Excellency, he says, if you ever wish to
again see the honourable and gracious lady
whom you love. Every moment is precious.
There is not a minute to be lost, you must hasten--hasten.
Soon it may be too late. For the wind
is already beginning to sing drearily in the eaves
of the house, and the raindrops are already overflowing
from the cups of the lotus leaves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And truly, as Ito spoke, a violent gust of wind
shook the woodwork of the little house, and huge
rain drops splashed into the lake outside.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas had turned pallid at Ito's interpretation
of the old soothsayer's mumbled words. For, in
spite of all his former professions of incredulity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
it was impossible not to be strangely and alarmingly
impressed at the unhappy forebodings contained
in this ominous prophecy.</p>

<p class="indent">The mountains--the woman he loved--the
madman, what and who else could they mean but
Chuzenji--Pearl--Martinworth? He did not
pause to ask himself how the old Bonze, living
buried in his little wooden house, miles away from
any European, could have obtained knowledge of
who he was, or of his intimate concerns. There
was a mystery, a weirdness in the whole strange
proceedings, that baffled investigation, or defied
analysis. Perhaps at some future time he would
try and solve the problem. But for the present
he was consumed with an unquestionable and
confident belief that the Seer's warning permitted
of no discussion--that what he foretold was indeed
occurring or about to occur, and that Pearl,
the being whom he loved most on earth, was in
some great danger, was helpless and alone, and
what was more, was needing him.</p>

<p class="indent">A merciful Providence in the form of a giddy
girl had guided his footsteps to this distant neighbourhood
and house. By these unforeseen and
unexpected means he had been warned of this
danger threatening the woman who was to be his
wife. And not for one instant did Stanislas, the
contemptuous sceptic of half an hour ago--the
practical product of a practical age--hesitate, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
think of ignoring this warning delivered in so unusual
a manner, from so unthought-of and so
strange a quarter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask him,&quot; he said to Ito, &quot;if the danger is
imminent, and if it can by any possible means be
averted?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ito put the question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He says, Excellency, that you must hasten,
hasten with all possible speed if you wish to see
the lady again. But he will not, he says--he cannot,
say more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas glanced at his watch. It was past
five o'clock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ito,&quot; he said, &quot;is there another train to Nikko
to-night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No Excellency, the last one left at three
o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there is one I know shortly for Utsunomiya.
I will take that, sleep the night there, and
get up to Chuzenji early to-morrow. Thank God!
I am near the station here. Ito, you will take
these ladies and this gentleman back to the hotel,
go to the Legation, get me some clothes, and
follow me by the first train to-morrow. Now call
me a <i>'ricksha</i> at once. I have just time to catch
the train.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Millward-Frasers had been silent and inactive,
but deeply interested and distressed spectators
of this scene. They saw that their friend,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
restrained and composed though he was in
manner, was possessed not only with the very
greatest anxiety, but likewise with an overwhelming
dread. They longed to be of help to him, but
knew not how.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned to the elder lady, &quot;You will forgive
me,&quot; he said, &quot;leaving you thus unceremoniously.
But I look upon that old man's words as a warning
sent from heaven. I feel that not only are
they not to be ignored, but that they must be
obeyed. And what is more, obeyed without delay.
One whom I love, who is to be my wife in a few
months time, is--according to this old man--in
imminent danger, and I must reach her, and go
to her assistance as speedily as lies in my power.
Listen to the wind and rain! Good God! the
first part of his prophecy is already coming true.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can we help you, dear friend? Do anything
for you at the Legation? Give any message?&quot;
asked Mrs. Millward-Fraser with tears of sympathy
in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can do nothing, dear Mrs. Millward-Fraser,
but pray for me in this the moment of the
greatest distress, the greatest agony of my life.
Stay, I will on second thoughts, take the carriage.
It is quicker, and the rain is coming down in
torrents. I will send it back to you, and also Ito,
who will return and see you safely home. Adieu!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And he was gone!</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="smcap">'Twixt Scylla and Charybdis.</span></p>

<p class="indent">It was two or three days before Monsieur de
Güldenfeldt's proposed return. And Pearl knew
that if her letter of rupture was to be sent at all
it was necessary to write it without further
delay.</p>

<p class="indent">For over an hour she had been sitting at her
writing table with the blank paper before her.
The atmosphere was heavy and close, signs of a
coming storm. Her head was aching, and her
sight dimmed with the pain.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, after merely inscribing a few words, she
impatiently threw down her pen, and, pushing
the writing materials aside, she rose from her
seat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There will be ample time to catch the post
when I come in,&quot; she thought. &quot;My head is
splitting. I shall die if I don't have some air.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sun was covered, but this by no means
prevented the heat from being stifling as Pearl
plodded along the path that overhung the lake.
Her feet lagged somewhat, but her thoughts on
the contrary, followed each other in rapid succession,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
and as she trudged through the undergrowth
she found herself recalling many incidents of her
past life. That unaccountable feeling of misery
and depression, that so often weighs down the
spirits before the coming of a typhoon, possessed
Mrs. Nugent this afternoon. This sentiment of
melancholy did not strike her as anything out of
the way, for it was indeed many a long day since
Pearl had known what it was to feel really happy
or light-hearted. She found her eyes filling with
tears of self-pity as she walked to the border of
the lake, and leaning against a tree, gazed down
sadly into its depths.</p>

<p class="indent">After all, she drearily thought, what a long
incessant struggle had been her life. What a
small, what a very small iota of happiness had
fallen to her lot. Pearl buried her face in her
hands, and wondered if, in any way, she had
brought these misfortunes on herself--if, indeed,
it had been through any fault of her own that
everyone whom she had trusted and loved had
proved false in the end, that everything she had
believed in had eventually turned to ashes in her
hands.</p>

<p class="indent">She thought of herself at the time of her marriage--bright,
and sunny, and single-hearted,
believing in everybody who was kind to her and
in everything that pleased her. She remembered
how this credulity, this innocent faith in all that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
was best in human nature, had blindly centred
itself in the husband whose utter worthlessness,
before many months were passed, was the cause
of a cruel awakening from this beautiful dream of
pure belief, resulting in disillusion, and in a bitter
lesson thoroughly learnt.</p>

<p class="indent">She recalled the wretched years that followed
this discovery of Mr. Norrywood's real disposition.
Then she thought of Martinworth, and how he
had come into her life, to transform its misery
into an unsatisfied, restless excitement, which, at
the time, she blindly deceived herself was happiness.
From Martinworth her thoughts turned to
the sweet widowed mother, who had died before
she left school, but whose example and teaching
had remained implanted in her mind, and was
the means of keeping her honest and pure through
many a bitter moment of trial and temptation.
Pearl loved to think of her mother. For long she
let her thoughts linger round this guardian angel
of her youth. It was a relief to turn them
away from herself, and to recall that tall,
stately figure, with the large grey eyes, so like
her own, the soft voice, and the grave, sweet
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">She sat down on a moss-grown boulder, and
dwelt tenderly on all the past incidents of her
merry childhood, and trusting, early girlhood.
And when at length she rose, and once more continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
her walk, Pearl Nugent's thoughts had
taken a new and a happier turn.</p>

<p class="indent">She wandered on, lingering here and there, and
occasionally plucking some of the many ferns and
wild flowers that grew by the path. Her eyes
travelled upwards and alighted, at some distance
above her, upon a plant she had long desired, a
magnificent specimen of the <i>Osmunda regina</i>.
Pearl paused in her walk, and found herself
speculating as to how greatly this giant fern would
adorn her rockery, one of the many beauties of
her lovely garden. Finally, with some difficulty,
she succeeded in clambering up the steep upright
bank, and regardless of the rising wind and the
rain that now began to fall, she attempted to
loosen the plant, and, for want of a better
instrument, commenced digging with her fingers
at the roots.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Nugent little knew that she had a solitary
but interested spectator of her proceedings.
Martinworth, in his boat on the lake, had caught
the flutter of a white dress through the trees, and,
with his keen sight, it did not take him long to
distinguish that the owner of the dress was Pearl.
He shipped his oars, and bending forward
watched with absorption the efforts to uproot the
fern. He had not long been thus silently employed
when, to his astonishment and dismay, he
saw her jerk suddenly backwards, and, sliding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
rapidly down the bank, disappear from view in a
cloud of earth and stones.</p>

<p class="indent">The plant that at one time seemed so firmly
and obstinately embedded in the ground had,
without warning, become loosened, and Pearl, in
giving one final pull, found herself thrown with
violence and unexpected impetus upon the path.</p>

<p class="indent">Her fall was not from any great height.
Though dazed for a minute by the suddenness of
her collapse, she was preparing to rise from her
lowly position when, in attempting to stand, a
sharp pain in her right ankle was an unmistakeable
and alarming proof that her foot was sprained.
With dismay and a smothered cry she fell back
again on the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">To make matters worse, the wind was rising
every minute, and the rain, increasing in force,
was penetrating the foliage overhead. Pearl
made a supreme effort to drag herself up by
catching at the branches and the brushwood, but
the pain of her foot was so intense that, greatly to
her annoyance, she found herself forced to desist
from her efforts.</p>

<p class="indent">The path was an unfrequented one. And it
was hardly a consoling thought that a night spent
in a dripping wood, with a possible typhoon
thrown in for company, was likely to prove the
result of her adventure. Indeed, this anticipation
was so little congenial to Pearl that she once more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
made a final effort to rise, the consequence being
that, certainly for a minute or two, she lost consciousness
from the pain.</p>

<p class="indent">She was aroused from this partial lethargy by a
rustling of the leaves, and the next minute the
form of Lord Martinworth emerged from behind
the trees.</p>

<p class="indent">On any other occasion Martinworth's sudden
appearance would have filled Mrs. Nugent with
the greatest dread and consternation. Her present
position was, however, proving so extremely
unpleasant that, forgetting all fears and past disagreeableness,
she found herself, on the contrary,
hailing his unexpected arrival on the scene with
intense relief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank goodness! you have come,&quot; she
exclaimed, as her face brightened. &quot;I have been
very unfortunate, and in falling have sprained my
ankle. I am quite helpless, and unable to
move.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Martinworth gazed down at the recumbent
form for a few seconds in silence. Then he
said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You seem indeed to be in a sorry plight.
The only thing I can suggest is that I should carry
you to my boat. I have got it moored close by,&quot;
and, without waiting for a reply, he stooped
down and gently lifted her in his arms. &quot;I will
row you home,&quot; he added. &quot;Put your arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
round my neck,&quot; and Pearl found herself obediently
following his directions.</p>

<p class="indent">It was with considerable difficulty, hampered
as he was by a burden by no means slight, that
Martinworth succeeded in threading his way
through the undergrowth. The climb down the
steep uneven bank was long and most laborious.</p>

<p class="indent">He was breathless when he at length deposited
Pearl by the edge of the lake.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must wait a moment,&quot; he panted, &quot;before
I attempt to lift you into the boat. The lake is
fearfully rough, and my little cockleshell is not
made for bad weather. We shall have to keep
by the shore. You are not afraid?&quot; and he
looked down at her with a strange light in his
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl hesitated a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she said at last, &quot;I don't think I am
afraid, at least, not very much. But I want to
get home as soon as possible. I have to write a
letter that must absolutely go by this evening's
post.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lord Martinworth looked at her fixedly, but
said nothing. And once more he stooped down
and lifted her in his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">It was no easy matter to place Pearl into the
little outrigger which was dancing like a cork on
the water, that from a calm and sunny lake had
in so short a time become transformed into a raging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
sea. Twice he missed his footing and nearly
fell, and twice he recovered himself, while Pearl
clung tightly to him, and felt his heart beating
against her own. The rain had ceased for the
moment, but the wind raged in greater fury than
ever, and it was already getting dusk. Lord
Martinworth's third effort, however, proved successful.
Depositing Pearl in the stern of the
boat, he took off his coat and made a cushion for
the injured foot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be an endless, a terrible business
getting back,&quot; he said, &quot;Don't stir. For as
it is, it will be all I can do to keep the boat
from upsetting. Steer as near the shore as you
can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl silently obeyed his directions, while Lord
Martinworth worked manfully at the sculls.</p>

<p class="indent">The boat, as he truly said, was not intended for
rough weather. Pearl soon realised this fact as it
danced up and down, backwards and forwards,
and the water came dashing over bow and stern.</p>

<p class="indent">At first the pair were silent, for all Martinworth's
breath was required for the effort of sculling
against the wind. But at last, during a lull in the
storm, his eyes wandered to his companion's face
and remained fixed there with a steadiness of gaze
which Pearl found anything but reassuring.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The wind is abating,&quot; he finally said. &quot;It is
fortunate, as I wish to ask you something, Pearl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
Mrs. Nugent did not reply, but her heart sank
within her.</p>

<p class="indent">For some moments Lord Martinworth still
rowed on, while it seemed as if his words were
likely to be verified. Though the roughness of
the water still tossed the helpless little boat, the
wind had temporarily almost dropped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We can drift in safety, now,&quot; he said, and
shipping his oars, he leant toward Pearl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pearl,&quot; he said very gently, &quot;I want you to be
true. I want you to frankly answer one or two
questions which, considering our former friendship,
I consider I have more than a right to ask.
First of all,&quot; and he paused a moment, &quot;I wish
to know, do you still love me, Pearl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The question came abruptly. Mrs. Nugent
was suffering considerable pain, and was feeling
very angry and rather frightened. She for a
moment forgot the past,--the devoted intercourse
of former years--everything but the
present trying situation,--and her answer without
hesitation was sharp and hard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have no right whatsoever to ask me such
a question. And you know it. It is an action
unworthy of you, to take advantage of my helplessness,
to place me in such an extremely
unpleasant position. But as you have thought fit
to question me, I will not be such a coward as to
shirk the answer. No, Dick, I certainly do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
care for you any longer. All that is passed. My
sentiments have--have--changed. I can only
thank God that all that folly is over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The words had hardly left Pearl's mouth
before she bitterly regretted them. She knew
they were harsh and cruel, and she was grieved
indeed when she saw the change that came over
Lord Martinworth's face that she had let her
sharp tongue and irritable temper get the better of
her.</p>

<p class="indent">He winced as if she had struck him, and his
cheeks turned white beneath the sunburn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; he replied with bitterness. &quot;You
are certainly carrying out my request to the letter,
and are frank enough. So this is the reward
for the devotion of years. Well! your answer
explains many things,&quot; he added musingly. &quot;First
of all I learn, that not only do you not love me now,
but what is more, that you never really cared for
me, never loved me as I loved you. I was a blind
fool not to have understood that fact many
years ago. You gave me proofs enough, God
knows.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg,&quot; retorted Pearl, but in a gentler tone,
&quot;that you will not discuss this question, Dick.
Did you not promise to bury what has gone?
Why move these gravestones of the past? Will
you not continue rowing? The wind is rising
again. I have nothing on but this thin, white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
gown, and I am cold and very anxious to get
home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; answered Martinworth sternly, &quot;I will
not go on rowing for the present. When I made
that promise the situation was entirely different.
You were not then--then----I have another
question still to ask. May I request that you will
give me as frank a reply to my second question as
you did to my first?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Nugent remained silent. She shivered
and looked anxiously towards the fast darkening
shore.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am really sorry to inconvenience you,&quot; continued
her companion, &quot;but it is absolutely
necessary for the purpose that I have in view that
these questions should be answered clearly,
frankly, and without delay. In fact it entirely
depends on the nature of the replies I receive
whether I carry out that purpose or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know what you are talking about,&quot;
replied Pearl petulantly. &quot;I am miserably cold
and wet. My foot is paining me very much.
Only get me home, and I will answer as many
questions as you please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me. One more question at least must
be answered now. But I will not delay you long.
Pearl Norrywood&quot;--he unconsciously used her
former name--&quot;as you one day expect to stand
before the Throne, tell me the truth. I must--I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
will know the truth. Are you or are you not
engaged to be married to de Güldenfeldt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As Martinworth uttered these words he leant
further forward, gazing intently at Pearl.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Nugent did not respond. She flushed, her
eyes falling beneath her companion's penetrating
glance. Fortunate indeed that she averted them
for a time. Thus for a short period, was she
saved the sight of the wildness of expression that
slowly crept over the face of her companion, as
the question brought forth no immediate reply.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Nugent continued silent. It was not from
any desire to prevaricate or to avoid telling the
necessary truth that she hesitated. But at the
moment that the question was asked, so sternly
and so impressively, it struck her like a blow how
very different might have been the answer if her
letter to de Güldenfeldt had been written and
despatched, instead of being still to write. She
began to realise, to dread, that this one act of procrastination--vacillation--weakness
of mind--whatever
it might be called--was likely to be productive
of calamitous results, feared and foreseen
for weeks.</p>

<p class="indent">As this thought passed through her mind she
instinctively raised her eyes to Martinworth's
face. That one glance was sufficient to impress
on her the certainty that she was in the presence,
not only of a madman, but of one who, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
premeditation, vindictiveness and ferocity of his
type, was she was firmly convinced, contemplating
her speedy destruction.</p>

<p class="indent">Strange to say, the conviction of this fact caused
her no immediate terror. Though of a naturally
timid and nervous temperament, Pearl, at this
moment of terrible and full assurance, felt none of
those depressing fears that had assailed her of late
with such crushing and ceaseless persistency. She
knew now, that from the moment she had seen
that look in Martinworth's eyes weeks ago, she
had been preparing herself for that fate which she
had then told herself must surely one day overtake
her. She was alone on a stormy lake with a
man no longer master of himself or of his actions.
The wind, which had risen again, was tearing
round in circles, the rain was dashing in their
faces, and the little boat was helplessly tossing first
one side and then the other. She looked up and
saw the angry heavens, she looked down and saw
the angry waters, she looked before her and saw
what was far more terrible than either--the angry
eyes, wild and threatening, fixed upon her face.
And yet Pearl felt no fear. Not for one moment
did she contemplate the thought of hiding the
truth by vain subterfuges, of cloaking it by prevarications.
She knew that in time, all in good
time, an answer must be given. And she likewise
knew that that answer would seal her fate. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
only wanted a short moment, a little space to think.
Not to weep over herself or bemoan her own
destiny, for an overwhelming pity for the man
before her, a deep compassion, took the place in
Pearl's breast, for the time being, of all natural
feelings of terror and dismay. It was her firm
conviction that this man, who had once been her
tender and adoring lover, was in a short space of
time about to become her assassin, and she asked
herself, as she gazed into his terrible face, what
must not have been his sufferings of late, that a
transformation such as this should have taken
place in the once gentle, well-balanced and affectionate
nature. As Pearl sat there, looking
silently and unflinchingly into those eyes, her
individuality for the moment seemed merged into
Martinworth's. Now for the first time did she
truly realise the misery and the despair that had
gripped his soul when, without a murmur, that
evening in Tokyo he had left her, resigning all
claim upon her for ever. The strain caused by
this voluntary renunciation of the desire of years
had, she knew well, proved too great for the highly-strung,
nervous disposition, and the will, once
under such calm self-control, the brain, once so
superior, had ultimately collapsed under this last
final effort of supreme self-denial.</p>

<p class="indent">This tragic and undoubtable fact was brought
vividly before her as she continued to gaze back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
into those eyes. She had retained her own self-respect,
she had acted up to the principles of her
youth, she had kept intact the promise she had
made--but--but--on the other side, she had
broken a heart, she had ruined a happy and a
useful life, and above all--she had unwittingly
driven a man mad for love of her! And in agony
of mind, Pearl asked herself the question, had she
done right? Oh! had she done right?</p>

<p class="indent">And all this time, while Lord Martinworth's
inquiry remained unanswered, his face was growing
more terrible, the steely blue eyes more bloodshot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Answer me,&quot; he said, and he leant forward
and caught her by the wrist. &quot;Are you engaged
to de Güldenfeldt? Do you hear me, Pearl?
Answer me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the contact of his hand on her wrist, Pearl
drew back and shuddered. She at last felt her
nerves giving way under the tension. And she
was aware that all feelings of self-reproach, regret,
and compassion were becoming submerged in a
more natural sentiment--that of genuine terror for
her own safety. She looked despairingly around
her, and saw with horror and dismay that they
were drifting towards the river that led to the
waterfall. The current was swift and strong at
that place, and she well knew that if Martinworth
did not at once take the oars it would merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
be a matter of minutes before they were dashed
over the brink into eternity! The knowledge
flashed upon her as they sped nearer and nearer
to the fatal spot that this was the end that from
the moment he had lifted her into his boat he
had decided upon. Again Pearl shuddered, as
her eyes fled once more to his face, and she knew
that further delay was impossible, and that she
must speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dick,&quot; she replied, &quot;you will kill me. I know
it. I read your intention in your face. You loved
me once, Dick, but now your love has turned to
hate. It is clear enough. Your hate is so bitter
that you will kill me. But I have never told you
a lie and I will not die with one on my lips.
Yes, I--I am engaged to Monsieur de Güldenfeldt,
but I am not----&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sentence remained unfinished. Martinworth
waited for no more. He started from his
seat, and shouting wildly, so that his ringing
voice was heard far above the roaring of the wind
and the waters: &quot;Never, Pearl! Never! Mine
at least in death,&quot; he stretched his arms towards
her, tore her from where she was crouching on
her seat, and clasped her to him. For a moment
they stood thus, locked in each other's arms,
tottering with unsteady feet in the fragile boat,
while he gazed with all the frenzy of insanity into
her white face. Then as his eyes lingered on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
hers, large with terror and despair, his sinister
intentions appeared to soften, for a change, sudden
and complete, passed over his face, transforming
the wild glare of madness into a look of
grief, despairing sorrow and reproof--sad and
mournful in the extreme. He stooped down, let
his eyes dwell on hers with the adoring look of
old, kissed her once tenderly, almost reverentially,
on the forehead, and replacing her as gently upon
her seat as he had torn her roughly from it, Lord
Martinworth balanced himself for one second on
the edge of the boat, then plunged headlong into
the seething lake!</p>

<p class="indent">One stifled cry mingled with the fury of the
wind as, with the violence of Martinworth's
movement, the little craft upset, and Pearl Nugent,
precipitated into the water, was hurled through
the rushing current, and carried helplessly
towards the waterfall!</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p class="h3">&quot;<span class="smcap">It is Best so, Amy, Dear.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And all through that dreadful night raged one
of the most terrible and disastrous typhoons that
had visited Japan for many years. Mrs. Nugent
and Lord Martinworth, not returning to their
respective domiciles, an immediate search was
instituted, but as the darkness deepened the wind
and rain increased in fury. It was a sheer impossibility
to stand up against the raging gale, and
eventually the hopeless search had to be temporarily
abandoned. In that one night the lake
rose six feet, huge landslips descended from
Nantai-san, and bridges and roads and dwellings
were washed away and demolished, as if mere
sheets of paper.</p>

<p class="indent">As dawn approached the torrents ceased, and
the wind abated.</p>

<p class="indent">At length the sun rose in full glory, casting in
brilliant irony its penetrating rays over this
grievous scene of waste and desolation. And
mingling with the foliage of a great tree blown
across the still raging stream the auburn tint of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
Pearl Nugent's hair shone like red gold among
the green.</p>

<p class="indent">On the upsetting of the boat she had been
borne down the torrent. A few seconds more
and she would have been dashed over the rocks,
hundreds of feet high, which form the cascade.
But some hours before, during the fury of the
storm, a giant pine tree had fallen with a deafening
crash half across the stream. It was that tree
that saved Pearl from a watery grave, for
wedged, as in a vice, between a fork of its
branches, her bruised, unconscious form was
ultimately discovered. Her head and shoulders
were out of the water, and the rushing stream,
instead of loosening, had apparently been the
means of entangling only more securely the rent
and dripping garments to the branches of the
tree. From the bank could be seen her head,
with its ashen face and closed eyes, thrown back
and pillowed, as it were, upon a wealth of green
foliage, while the torrent tore around her with
raging fury, in its onward relentless course
battering and bruising the delicate limbs.</p>

<p class="indent">It was at considerable risk to their own lives
that Ralph and Count Carlitti, and other brave
men with them, crept cautiously and with the
greatest difficulty along the trunk of the tree, over
the greater part of which the water was still
rushing. By dint of clinging with all their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
strength to the upstanding branches they at last
succeeded after many vain attempts and countless
perils, in reaching the tossed, unconscious
form.</p>

<p class="indent">Count Carlitti clung on to Ralph with all his
force, while the latter laid himself down flat on
the trunk, and set about cutting away, as best he
could, the remnants of Pearl's clothing from the
branches. After a wearisome, and what appeared
an endless time, this difficult task was at length
successfully accomplished, enabling them to drag
the inanimate body gently and tenderly along
the trunk of the tree, finally rescuing it from
the watery bed in which it had been helplessly
tossed by the stormy elements for so many
hours.</p>

<p class="indent">As Ralph bent his head, resting it on her breast,
his face brightened somewhat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Her heart beats,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Thank
God she still lives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Between them they bore her home, and laid her
with loving care on the little bed from which
Pearl Nugent was fated never to rise again, for
human skill was unavailing.</p>

<p class="indent">The army doctor from Hong-Kong, who some
weeks before had attended Martinworth, was still
at Chuzenji. He did his utmost to relieve all
pain, and indeed on recovering consciousness
Pearl suffered but little. Her spine, independent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
of other severe internal injuries, was discovered
fatally damaged, and Pearl and those around her
knew that she was dying. She lingered all that
day and all the next, sweet and patient to the end.
Rosina and Amy and Lady Martinworth were there.
They never left the bedside, and the latter's
medical knowledge and gentle, experienced
nursing helped greatly to lighten and relieve those
last sad and distressing days.</p>

<p class="indent">Shortly after Mrs. Nugent had awakened from
the deathlike swoon that had lasted so many hours,
and when in spite of her diminishing forces she
was quite capable of understanding what was
wanted of her, she slowly and painfully turned
her head on the pillow, and letting her veiled orbs
linger on the face bending over her, she read the
mute question expressed by Lady Martinworth's
miserable eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">She put out her hand and gently drew her face
to hers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is--drowned,&quot; she whispered. &quot;We were--together.
The boat upset--in the storm.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That was all. And surely when her spirit
stands in judgment before the Throne, Pearl
Nugent will be pardoned for having said no
more.</p>

<p class="indent">She would lie silent and motionless, with her
beautiful soft grey eyes, dark with the shadow of
death, wide open, while from time to time she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
would smile with an angelic sweetness at the three
women who were watching her.</p>

<p class="indent">She spoke but little. Indeed with these few
rare exceptions she hardly noticed her watchers,
for her thoughts seemed far away from all earthly
things. The next day, however, towards the end,
as Amy, weeping, was leaning over the bed, she
smiled back into her eyes, and whispered very
low:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is--best so, Amy, dear. Do not weep--for
me. I am quite content--more content, more at
peace than I have been--for many, many long
years. If I had lived--I should not have been
happy--nor--should I--have made others--Stanislas--dear,
good kind Stanislas--happy.
Yes,--it is--best so. I am--quite ready,--quite--willing
to--die. No more--difficulties, or--dread,
or--terrible indecision,--or--uncertainty
now. No more unhappiness--now. All--soon
will be made--clear, Amy, dear. When--I am
gone--be kind--to Stanislas,--poor--Stanislas,
for--he--will grieve, and thank--God--he--will
never--know--now, never--know--now. Do
not--weep for me, darling. I--have--always--loved--you--Amy.
Please--please--do not--weep--so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And then after a minute or two she sighed and
asked: &quot;Where--is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ralph went to Tokyo at once to tell him,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>
answered Amy, her voice choked with sobs.
&quot;Telegraphic communication has been interrupted
by the storm, and the road is washed away. No
one can go down or come up from Nikko. Ralph,
however, will have got there, Pearl, my darling,
even if he had to climb twenty mountains. They
will soon be here, darling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; whispered Pearl softly, &quot;he will be here--before
I die. He is--coming. He knows--I
want him. But he--will grieve, poor--Stanislas,--poor--true--heart,
he--will grieve,--but--thank
God!--he will--never--know--now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she turned her head, and for the last time,
and in unbroken silence, she gazed out far before
her at the mountains and the lake.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the following morning shortly after dawn
that the doctor told them she could not last much
longer. And even as he was making this sad
announcement Stanislas de Güldenfeldt, accompanied
by Ralph, who had met him half way
to Tokyo, weary and worn and travel stained,
appeared outside the house.</p>

<p class="indent">Pearl, who had been lying partially unconscious
for many hours, suddenly awoke from her
torpor, and raising her head from the pillow, gazed
fixedly with shining eyes through the open <i>shoji</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stanislas has come! He is near me!&quot; she
called in a clear and ringing voice, &quot;Bring him
to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
Rosina exchanged a glance of surprise with
Amy as she left the room, for from where
Pearl was lying in bed it was impossible for her
to see her lover, and silence reigned,--no word
had been spoken.</p>

<p class="indent">Stanislas de Güldenfeldt, exhausted by sorrow
and fatigue, went alone into the room of his dying
love. And when, over an hour later, the others,
anxious at the ominous silence, ventured within
the death-chamber, they found him kneeling by
the bedside--unconscious,--his dark hair mingling
on the pillow with Pearl's auburn curls, while her
dead cheek was pressed against his lips, and her
dead arms were clasped around his neck.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="indent">Stanislas never completely recovered from the
shock and grief of Pearl's tragic death. Shortly
following her loss he left the Diplomatic Service.
He was strongly advised against this step by his
many friends, amongst whom, as his truest and
his best, he counted not only the Rawlinsons
and Sir Ralph and Lady Nicholson, but his
former colleague, Count Carlitti, who in fair
Japan, falling a victim to the freshness of Muriel
Millward-Fraser, had promptly, within two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span>
months of Mrs. Nugent's death, placed his ancient
name and title, to say nothing of his &quot;leetle
fortune,&quot; in all their completeness at the extremely
pretty feet of &quot;<i>cette belle jeune fille Anglaise</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the counsels of de Güldenfeldt's friends fell
on deaf ears. He took a hatred for the Service,
and never for a moment in the future did he
regret his former busy and interesting life. He
made England the country of his adoption,
buying himself a small but beautiful estate in
one of the western counties. There, surrounded
by his lovely garden and orchid houses, his books,
and portraits and souvenirs of Pearl, he passed--if
not a happy--at any rate a peaceful existence,
and when not at home he spent much of his
time with the Nicholsons, whose lovely place was
in the adjoining county.</p>

<p class="indent">His devotion to his god-daughter, Pearl Nicholson,
was profound. And to her alone was he
ever known to mention the name of his dead love.
Many were the talks that this strange pair, the
elderly, saddened man and the innocent child,
held on this subject. But to the last, to no other
person, not even to Rosina or to Amy, did
Stanislas de Güldenfeldt ever refer directly to
that unforgotten page that influenced every
thought and action of his life.</p>

<p class="indent">This sweet confidence between the man and
child had arisen in this way.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
Seven or eight years after Pearl's death, while
the Nicholsons were paying their annual visit to
Lynlath, Stanislas entered one day, somewhat
unexpectedly, into his library. There, in front of
a full length and most successful portrait of Mrs.
Nugent, painted after her death from photographs
and description, was standing, with uplifted head
and sorrowful visage--his little god-daughter.
The child's hands were clasped behind her back,
and the same gleam of sun that lit up the sweet,
lovely face of the portrait fell across the golden
locks of the little girl, as she turned towards
Stanislas with tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have, godpapa,&quot; she said, &quot;so many
pictures of this beautiful lady with the large grey
eyes. What lovely hair she has! But what a
sad, sad face! I feel I love her so, and often and
often I come in here and look at her, and she
seems to talk to me. Tell me about her, godpapa.
Did you love her too?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Stanislas de Güldenfeldt took Pearl's
namesake on his knee, and with sad eyes gazing
back far into the past he told her of his eternal
love.</p>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
